<p class="h2sub">THE ODOUR OF THE OINTMENT</p>

<p>Ascension lilies were everywhere in our shabby
drawing-room. They crowded two tables and filled
a corner and rose, slim and white, atop a Sheraton
cabinet. Every one had sent Pelleas and me a sheaf
of the flowers—the Chartres, the Cleatams, Miss
Willie Lillieblade, Enid, Lisa and dear Hobart Eddy
had all remembered us on Easter eve, and we entered
our drawing-room after breakfast on Easter
morning to be all but greeted with a winding of the
white trumpets. The sun smote them and they
were a kind of candle, their light secretly diffused,
premonitory of Spring, of some resurrection of light
as a new element. It was a wonderful Easter day,
and in spite of our sad gray hair Pelleas and I were
never in fairer health; yet for the first time in our
fifty years together Easter found us close prisoners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
Easter morning, and we were forbidden to leave the
house!</p>

<p>“Etarre,” Pelleas said, with some show of firmness,
“there is no reason in the world why we should
not go.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well now,” I said with a sigh, “I wish you
could prove that to Nichola. Do I not know it
perfectly already?”</p>

<p>It is one sign of our advancing years, we must
suppose, that we are prone to predicate of each other
the trifles which heaven sends. The sterner things
we long ago learned to accept with our hands clasped
in each other’s; but when the postman is late or the
hot water is cold or we miss our paper we have a
way of looking solemnly sidewise.</p>

<p>We had gone upstairs the night before in the best
of humours, Pelleas carrying an Ascension lily to
stand in the moonlight of our window, for it always
seems to us the saddest injustice to set the sullen
extinguisher of lowered lights on the brief life of a
flower. And we had been looking forward happily
to Easter morning when the service is always inseparable
from a festival of Spring. Then, lo! when we
were awakened there was the treacherous world one
glitter of ice. Branches sparkled against the blue,
the wall of the park was a rampart of silver and the
faithless sidewalks were mockeries of thoroughfare.
But the grave significance of this did not come to us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
until Nichola entered the dining-room with the griddle-cakes
and found me dressed in my gray silk and
Pelleas in broadcloth.</p>

<p>“Is it,” asked our old serving-woman, who rules
us as if she had brought us from Italy and we had
not, more than forty years before, tempted her from
her native Capri, “is it that you are mad, with this
ice everywhere, everywhere?”</p>

<p>“It is Easter morning, Nichola,” I said, with the
mildness of one who supports a perfect cause.</p>

<p>“Our Lady knows it is so,” Nichola said, setting
down her smoking burden, “but the streets are so
thick with ice that one breaks one’s head a thousand
times. You must not think of so much as stepping
in the ar-y.”</p>

<p>She left the room, and the honey-brown cakes
cooled while Pelleas and I looked at each other aghast.
To miss our Easter service for the first time in our
life together! The thought was hardly to be borne.
We reasoned with Nichola when she came back and
I think that Pelleas even stamped his foot under the
table; but she only brought more cakes and shook
her head, the impertinent old woman who has conceived
that she must take care of us.</p>

<p>“One breaks one’s head a thousand times,” she
obstinately repeated. “Our Lady would not wish
it. Danger is not holy.”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, as Pelleas and I looked sorrowfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
from the window above the Ascension lilies we
knew that there was reason in the situation, for the
streets were perilous even to see. None the less we
were frankly resentful, for it is bad enough to have
a disagreeable matter occur without having reason
on its side. As for our carriage, that went long ago
together with the days when Pelleas could model and
I could write so that a few were deceived; and as
for a cab to our far downtown church and back, that
was not to be considered. For several years now
we have stepped, as Nichola would say, softly, softly
from one security to another so that we need not
give up our house; and even now we are seldom sure
that one month’s comfort will keep its troth with the
next. Since it was too icy to walk to the car we
must needs remain where we were.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said I, as if it were a matter of opinion,
“that it is really Easter uptown too. But some
way—”</p>

<p>“I know,” Pelleas said. Really, of all the pleasures
of this world I think that the “I know” of Pelleas
in answer to something I have left unsaid is the
last to be foregone. I hope that there is no one who
does not have this delight.</p>

<p>“Pelleas—” I began tremblingly to suggest.</p>

<p>“Ah, well now,” Pelleas cried, resolutely, “let us
go anyway. We can walk beside the curb slowly.
And after all, we do not belong to Nichola.” Really,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
of all the pleasures of this world I think that the
daring of Pelleas in moments when I am cowardly
is quite the last to be renounced. I hope that there
is no one who has not the delight of living near some
one a bit braver than himself.</p>

<p>With one accord we slipped from the drawing-room
and toiled up the stairs. I think, although we
would not for the world have said so, that there may
have been in our minds the fear that this might be
our last Easter together and, if it was to be so, then
to run away to Easter service would be a fitting memory,
a little delicious human thing to recall among
austerer glories. Out of its box in a twinkling came
my violet bonnet and I hardly looked in a mirror as
I put it on. I fastened my cloak wrong from top
to bottom and seized two right-hand gloves and
thrust them in my muff. Then we opened the door
and listened. There was not a sound in the house.
We ventured into the passage and down the stairs,
and I think we did not breathe until the outer door
closed softly upon us. For Nichola, we have come
to believe, is a mystic and thinks other people’s
thoughts. At all events, she finds us out so often
that we prefer to theorize that it is her penetration
and not our clumsiness which betrays us.</p>

<p>Nichola had already swept the steps with hot water
and salt and ashes and sawdust combined; Nichola
is so thorough that I am astonished she has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
corrupted me with the quality. Yet no sooner was
I beyond the pale of her friendly care than I overestimated
thoroughness, like the weak character that
I am, and wished that the whole street had practiced
it. I took three steps on that icy surface and stood
still, desperately.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said, weakly, “I feel—I feel like a
little nut on top of a big, frosted, indigestible cake.”</p>

<p>I laughed a bit hysterically and Pelleas slipped
my arm more firmly in his and we crept forward
like the hands of a clock, Pelleas a little the faster, as
became the tall minute hand. We turned the
corner safely and had one interminable block to
traverse before we reached the haven of the car. I
looked down that long expanse of slippery gray,
unbroken save where a divine janitor or two had
interposed, and my courage failed me. And Pelleas
rashly ventured on advice.</p>

<p>“You walk too stiffly, Etarre,” he explained.
“Relax, relax! Step along slowly but easily, as I
do. Then, if you fall, you fall like a child—no
jar, no shock, no broken bones. Now relax—”</p>

<p>And Pelleas did so. Before I could shape my
answer Pelleas had relaxed. He lay in a limp little
heap on the ice beside me, and I shall never forget
my moment of despair.</p>

<p>I do not know where she came from, but while I
stood there hopelessly reiterating, “Pelleas—why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Pelleas!” on the verge of tears, she stepped from
some door of the air to my assistance. She wore a
little crimson hat and a crimson collar, but her poor
coat, I afterward noted, was sadly worn. At the
moment of her coming it was her clear, pale face that
fixed itself in my grateful memory. She darted
forward, stepped down from the curb and held out
two hands to Pelleas.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” she said, “I can help you. I have on
rubber boots.”</p>

<p>Surely no interfering goddess ever arrived in a
more practical frame of mind.</p>

<p>When Pelleas was on his feet, looking about
him in a dazed and rather unforgiving fashion,
the little maid caught off her crimson muffler and
brushed his coat. Pelleas, with bared head, made
her as courtly a bow as his foothold permitted, and
she continued to stand somewhat shyly before us
with the prettiest anxiety on her face, shaking the
snow from her crimson muffler.</p>

<p>“You are not hurt, sir?” she asked, and seemed
so vastly relieved at his reassurance that she quite
won our hearts. “Now,” she said, “won’t you let
me walk with you? My rubber boots will do for
all three.”</p>

<p>We each accepted her arm without the smallest
protest. I will hazard that no shipwrecked sailor
ever inquired of the rescuing sail whether he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
inconveniencing it. Once safely aboard, however,
and well under way, he may have symbolized his
breeding to the extent of offering a faint, polite
resistance.</p>

<p>As “Shall we not be putting you out?” Pelleas
inquired, never offering to release her arm.</p>

<p>And “I’m afraid we are,” I ventured, pressing to
her all the closer. She was frail as I, too, and it
was not the rubber boots to which I pinned my faith;
she was young, and you can hardly know what safety
that bespeaks until you are seventy, on ice.</p>

<p>“It’s just there, on the south corner of the avenue,”
Pelleas explained apologetically, and for the first
time I perceived that by common consent we had
turned back toward home. But neither of us mentioned
that.</p>

<p>Then, as we stepped forward, with beautiful
nicety rounding the corner to come upon our entrance,
suddenly, without a moment’s warning, our
blackest fears were fulfilled. We ran full upon
Nichola.</p>

<p>“Ah, I told you, Pelleas!” I murmured; which
I had not, but one has to take some comfort in crises.</p>

<p>Without a word Nichola wheeled solemnly, grasped
my other arm and made herself fourth in our singular
party. Her gray head was unprotected and her hair
stood out all about it. She had thrown her apron
across her shoulders and great patches in her print<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
gown were visible to all the world. When Nichola’s
sleeves wear out she always cuts a piece from the
front breadth of her skirt to mend them, trusting to
her aprons to conceal the lack. She was a sorry
old figure indeed, out there on the avenue in the
Easter sunshine, and I inclined bitterly to resent her
interference.</p>

<p>“Nichola,” said I, haughtily, “one would think
that we were obliged to be wheeled about on casters.”</p>

<p>Nichola made but brief reply.</p>

<p>“Our Lady knows you’d be better so,” she said.</p>

<p>So that was how, on Easter morning, with the bells
pealing like a softer silver across the silver of the
city, Pelleas and I found ourselves back in our lonely
drawing-room considerably shaken and hovering
before the fire which Nichola stirred to a leaping
blaze. And with us, since we had insisted on her
coming, was our new little friend, fluttering about
us with the prettiest concern, taking away my cloak,
untying my bonnet and wheeling an arm-chair for
Pelleas, quite as if she were the responsible little
hostess and we her upset guests. Presently, the
bright hat and worn coat laid aside, she sat on a hassock
before the blaze and looked up at us, like a little
finch that had alighted at our casement and had been
coaxed within. I think that I love best these little
bird-women whom one expects at any moment to
hear thrilling with a lilt of unreasonable song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“My dear,” said I, on a sudden, “how selfish
of us. I dare say you will have been going to
church?”</p>

<p>She hesitated briefly.</p>

<p>“I might ’a’ gone to the mission,” she explained,
unaccountably colouring, “but I don’t know if I
would. On Easter.”</p>

<p>“But I should have thought,” I cried, “that this
is the day of days to go.”</p>

<p>“It would be,” she assented, “it would be—”
she went on, hesitating, “but, ma’am, I can’t bear
to go,” she burst out, “because they don’t have no
flowers. We go to the mission,” she added, “and
not to the grand churches. And it seems—it
seems—don’t you think God must be where the
most flowers are? An’ last Easter we only had one
geranium.”</p>

<p>Bless the child. I must be a kind of pagan, for
I understood.</p>

<p>“Your flowers are beau-tiful,” she said, shyly, with
a breath of content. “Are they real? I’ve been
wantin’ to ask you. I never saw so many without
the glass in front. But they don’t smell much,” she
added, wistfully; “I wonder why that is?”</p>

<p>Pelleas and I had been wondering that very morning.
They looked so sweet-scented and yet were
barren of fragrance; and we had told ourselves
that perhaps they were lilies of symbol without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
mission or message beyond the symbol, without hue
or passion or, so to say, experience.</p>

<p>“Perhaps if one were to make some one happy
with them or to put them in a bride’s bouquet they
would no longer be scentless,” Pelleas quaintly said.</p>

<p>But now my mind was busy with other problems
than those of such fragrance.</p>

<p>“Where do you go to church, my dear?” I asked,
not daring to glance at Pelleas.</p>

<p>“To the mission,” she said, “over—” and she
named one of the poorest of the struggling East Side
chapels. “It’s just started,” she explained, “an’
the lady that give most, she died, and the money
don’t come. And poor Mr. Lovelow, he’s the
minister and he’s sick—but he preaches, anyhow.
And pretty near nobody comes to hear him,” she
added, with a curious, half-defiant emotion, her
cheeks still glowing. It was strange that I who am
such a busybody of romance was so slow to comprehend
that betraying colour.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I knew where the mission was. We
had even peeped into it one Sunday when, though it
was not quite finished, they were trying to hold service
from the unpainted pulpit. I remembered the
ugly walls covered with the lead-pencil calculations
of the builders, the forlorn reed organ, the pushing
feet upon the floor. And now “the lady who give
most” had died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“Last Easter,” our little friend was reiterating,
“we had one geranium that the minister brought.
But now his mother is dead and I guess he won’t be
keeping plants. Men always lets ’em freeze. Mis’
Sledge, she’s got a cactus, but it hasn’t bloomed yet.
Maybe she’ll take that. And they said they was
going to hang up the letters left from last Christmas,
for the green. They don’t say nothing but
‘Welcome’ and ‘Star of Bethlehem,’ but I s’pose
the ‘Welcome’ is always nice for a church, and I
s’pose the star shines all year round, if you look.
But they don’t much of anybody come. Mr. Lovelow,
he’s too sick to visit round much. Last Sunday
they was only ’leven in the whole room.”</p>

<p>“Only ’leven in the whole room.” It hardly
seemed credible in New York. But I knew the poverty
of some of the smaller missions, especially in a
case where “the lady that give most” has died. And
this poor young minister, this young Mr. Lovelow
whose mother had died and who was too sick to
“visit round much,” and doubtless had an indifferent,
poverty-ridden parish which no other pastor
wanted—I knew in an instant the whole story of
the struggle. I looked over at our pots of Ascension
lilies and I found myself unreasonably angry with
the dear Cleatams and Chartres and Hobart Eddy
and the rest for the self-indulgence of having given
them to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>At that moment my eyes met those of Pelleas. He
was leaning forward, looking at me with an expression
of both daring, and doubt of my approval, and I
saw his eyes go swiftly to the lilies. What was he
contriving, I wondered, my heart beating. He was
surely not thinking of sending our lilies over to the
mission, for we could never get them all there in
time and Nichola—</p>

<p>“Etarre!” said Pelleas—and showed me in a
moment heights of resourcefulness to which I can
never attain—“Etarre! It is only half after ten.
We can’t go out to service—and the mission is not
four blocks from us. Why not have our little friend
run over there and, if there are only two dozen or so
in the chapel, have that young Mr. Lovelow bring
them all over here, and let it be Easter in this room?”</p>

<p>He waved his hand toward the lilies waiting there
all about the walls and doing no good to any save
a selfish old man and woman. He looked at me,
almost abashed at his own impulse. Was ever
such a practical Mahomet, proposing to bring to
himself some Mountain Delectable?</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” I asked breathlessly, “to let
them have services in this—”</p>

<p>“Here with us, in the drawing-room,” Pelleas
explained. “Why not? There were fifty in the
room for that Lenten morning musicale. There’s
the piano for the music. And the lilies—the lilies—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Of course we will,” I cried. “But, O, will
they come? Do you think they will come?”</p>

<p>I turned to our little friend, and she had risen and
was waiting with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“O, ma’am,” she said, trembling, “why, ma’am!
O, yes’m, they’ll come. I’ll get ’em here myself.
O, Mr. Lovelow, he’ll be so glad....”</p>

<p>She flew to her bright hat and worn coat and
crimson muffler.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lovelow says,” she cried, “that a shabby
church is just as much a holy temple as the ark of
the gover’ment—but he was so glad when we dyed
the spread for the orgin—O, ma’am,” she broke
off, knotting the crimson scarf about her throat,
“do you really want ’em? They ain’t—you know
they don’t look—”</p>

<p>“Hurry, child,” said Pelleas, “and mind you
don’t let one of them escape!”</p>

<p>When she was gone we looked at each other in
panic.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I cried, trembling, “think of all there
is to be done in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>Pelleas brushed this aside as a mere straw in the
wind.</p>

<p>“Think of Nichola,” he portentously amended.</p>

<p>In all our flurry we could not help laughing at the
frenzy of our old servant when we told her. Old
Nichola was born upon the other side of every argument.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
In her we can see the history of all the
world working out in a miniature of wrinkles. For
Nichola would have cut off her gray hair with Sparta,
hurled herself fanatically abroad on St. Bartholomew’s
day, borne a pike before the Bastile, broken
and burned the first threshing-machine in England,
stoned Luther, and helped to sew the stars upon
striped cloth in the kitchen of Betsy Ross.</p>

<p>“For the love of heaven,” cried Nichola, “church
in the best room! It is not holy. Whoever heard
o’ church in a private house, like a spiritualist seeonce
or whatever they are. An’ me with a sponge-cake
in the oven,” she concluded fervently. “Heaven
be helpful, mem, I wish’t you’d ’a’ went to church
yourselves.”</p>

<p>Chairs were drawn from the library and dining-room
and from above-stairs, and frantically dusted
with Nichola’s apron. The lilies were turned from
the windows to look inward on the room and a
little table for the Bible was laid with a white cloth
and set with a vase of lilies. And in spite of Nichola,
who every moment scolded and prophesied and
nodded her head in the certainty that all the thunders
of the church would descend upon us, we were ready
when the door-bell rang. I peeped from the drawing-room
window and saw that our steps were filled!</p>

<p>“Nichola,” said I, trembling, “you will come up
to the service, will you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Nichola shook her old gray head.</p>

<p>“It’s a nonsense,” she shrilly proclaimed. “It
will not be civilized. It will not be religious. I’ll
open the door on ’em, but I won’t do nothink elst,
mem.”</p>

<p>When we heard their garments in the hall and the
voice of Little Friend, Pelleas pushed back the
curtains and there was our Easter, come to us upon
the threshold.</p>

<p>I shall not soon forget the fragile, gentle figure
who led them. The Reverend Stephen Lovelow
came in with outstretched hand, and I have forgotten
what he said or indeed whether he spoke at all.
But he took our hands and greeted us as the disciple
must have greeted the host of that House of the Upper
Room. We led the way to the table where he laid
his worn Bible and he stood in silence while the
others found their places, marshaled briskly by
Little Friend who as captain was no less efficient
than as deliverer. There were chairs to spare, and
when every one was seated, in perfect quiet, the young
clergyman bowed his head:—</p>

<p>“Lord, thou hast made thy face to shine upon
us—” he prayed, and it seemed to me that our
shabby drawing-room was suddenly quick with a
presence more intimate than that of the lilies.</p>

<p>When the hymn was given out and there was a
fluttering of leaves of the hymn-books they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
brought, five of our guests at a nod from Mr. Lovelow
made their way forward. One was a young woman
with a ruddy face, but ruddy with that strange,
wrinkled ruddiness of age rather than youth, who
wore a huge felt hat laden with flaming roses evidently
added expressly for Easter day. She had on
a thin waist of flimsy pink with a collar of beads and
silver braid, and there were stones of all colours in a
half-dozen rings on her hands. She took her place
at the piano with an ease almost defiant and she
played the hymn not badly, I must admit, and
sang in a full riotous soprano. Meanwhile, at her
side was ranged the choir. There were four—a
great watch-dog of a bass with swelling veins upon
his forehead and erect reddish hair; a little round
contralto in a plush cap and a dress trimmed with
the appliquéd flowers cut from a lace curtain; a
tall, shy soprano who looked from one to another
through the hymn as if she were in personal exhortation;
and a pleasant-faced tenor who sang with a
will that was good to hear and was evidently the
choir leader, for he beat time with a stumpy, cracked
hand set with a huge black ring on its middle finger.
The little woman next me offered her book and I had
a glimpse of a pinched side-face, with a displaced
strand of gray hair and a loose linen collar with no
cravat, but I have seldom heard a sweeter voice than
that which up-trembled beside me—although, poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
little woman! she was sadly ill at ease because the
thumb which rested on the book next me was thrust
in a glove fully an inch too long. As for Pelleas, he
was sharing a book with a youngish man, stooped,
long-armed, with a mane of black hair, whom Mr.
Lovelow afterward told me had lost his position in
a sweat-shop through drawing some excellent cartoons
on the box of his machine. Mr. Lovelow
himself was “looking over” with a mother and
daughter who were later presented to us, and who
embarrassed any listener by persistently talking in
concert, each repeating a few words of what the other
had just said, quite in the fashion of the most gently
bred talkers bent upon assuring each other of their
spontaneous sympathy and response.</p>

<p>And what a hymn it was! After the first stanza
they gained in confidence, and a volume of sound
filled the low room—ay, and a world of spirit, too.
“Christ the Lord is risen to-day, Hallelu—jah! ...”
they caroled, and Pelleas, who never can sing a tune
aloud although he declares indignantly that in his
head he keeps it perfectly, and I, who do not sing at
all, both joined perforce in the triumphant chorus.
Ah, I dare say that farther down the avenue were
sweet-voiced choirs that sang music long rehearsed,
golden, flowing, and yet I think there was no more
fervent Easter music than that in which we joined.
It was as if the other music were the censer-smoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and we were its shadow on the ground, but a
proof of the sun for all that.</p>

<p>I cannot now remember all that simple service,
perhaps because I so well remember the glory of the
hour. I sat where I could see the park stretching
away, black upon silver and silver upon black, over
the Ascension lilies. The face of the young minister
was illumined as he read and talked to his people. I
think that I have never known such gentleness, never
such yearning and tenderness as were his with that
handful of crude and careless and devout. And
though he spoke passionately and convincingly I
could not but think that he was like some dumb
thing striving for the utterance of the secret fire
within—striving to “burn aloud,” as a violin beseeches
understanding. Perhaps there is no other
way to tell the story of that first day of the week—“early,
when it was yet dark.”</p>

<p>“They had brought sweet spices,” he said, “with
which to anoint Him. Where are the spices that
we have brought to-day? Have we aught of sacrifice,
of charity, of zeal, of adoration—let us lay
them at His feet, an offering acceptable unto the Lord,
a token of our presence at the door of the sepulcher
from which the stone was rolled away. Where are
the sweet spices of our hands, where the pound of
ointment of spikenard wherewith we shall anoint the
feet of our living Lord? For if we bring of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
spiritual possession, the Christ will suffer us, even
as He suffered Mary; and the house shall be filled
with the odour of the ointment.”</p>

<p>“And the house shall be filled with the odour of
the ointment,” I said over to myself. Is it not
strange how a phrase, a vista, a bar of song, a thought
beneath the open stars, will almost pierce the veil?</p>

<p>“And the house shall be filled with the odour of
the ointment,” I said silently all through the last
prayer and the last hymn and the benediction of
“The Lord make his face to shine upon you, the
Lord give you peace.” And some way, with our
rising, the abashment which is an integral part of
all such gatherings as we had convoked was not to
be reckoned with, and straightway the presentations
and the words of gratitude and even the pretty anxiety
of Little Friend fluttering among us were spontaneous
and unconstrained. It was quite as if,
Pelleas said afterward, we had been reduced to a
common denominator. Indeed, it seems to me in
remembering the day as if half the principles of
Christian sociology were illustrated there in our
shabby drawing-room; but for that matter I would
like to ask what complexities of political science,
what profound bases of <i>solidarité</i>, are not on
the way to be solved in the presence of Easter
lilies? I am in all these matters most stupid
and simple, but at all events I am not blameful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
enough to believe that they are exhausted by the
theories.</p>

<p>Every one lingered for a little, in proof of the success
of our venture. Pelleas and I talked with the
choir and with the pianiste, and this lady informed
us that our old rosewood piano, which we apologetically
explained to have been ours for fifty years,
was every bit as good and every bit as loud as a new
golden-oak “instrument” belonging to her sister.
The tall, shy soprano told us haltingly how much
she had enjoyed the hour and her words conveyed
sincerity in spite of her strange system of overemphasis
of everything she said, and of carrying down
the corners of her mouth as if in deprecation. The
plump little contralto thanked us, too, with a most
winning smile—such round open eyes she had, immovably
fixed on the object of her attention, and as
Pelleas said such <i>evident</i> eyes.</p>

<p>“Her eyes looked so amazingly like eyes,” he
afterward commented whimsically.</p>

<p>We talked too with the little woman of the long-thumbed
gloves who had the extraordinary habit of
smiling faintly and turning away her head whenever
she detected any one looking at her. And the sweat-shop
cartoonist proved to be an engaging young giant
with the figure of a Greek god, classic features, a manner
of gravity amounting almost to hauteur, and as
pronounced an East Side dialect as I have ever heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Will you not let us,” I said to him, after Mr.
Lovelow’s word about his talent, “see your drawings
sometime? It would give us great pleasure.”</p>

<p>Whereupon, “Sure. Me, I’ll toin de whol’ of ’em
over to youse,” said the Greek god, thumbs out and
shoulders flickering.</p>

<p>But back of these glimpses of reality among them
there was something still more real; and though I
dare say there will be some who will smile at the
affair and call that interest curiosity and those
awkward thanks mere aping of convention, yet Pelleas
and I who have a modest degree of intelligence
and who had the advantage of being present do affirm
that on that Easter morning countless little doors
were opened in the air to admit a throng of presences.
We cannot tell how it may have been, and we are
helpless before all argument and incredulity, but we
know that a certain stone was rolled away from the
door of the hearts of us all, and there were with us
those in shining garments.</p>

<p>In the midst of all I turned to ask our Little
Friend some trivial thing and I saw that which made
my old heart leap. Little Friend stood before a
table of the lilies and with her was young Mr. Lovelow.
And something—I cannot tell what it may
have been, but in these matters I am rarely mistaken;
and something—as she looked up and he
looked down—made me know past all doubting how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
it was with them. And this open secret of their love
was akin to the mysteries of the day itself. The
gentle, sad young clergyman and our Little Friend
of the crimson muffler had suddenly opened to us
another door and admitted another joyous presence.
I cannot tell how it may be with every one else but for
Pelleas and me one such glimpse—a glimpse of
two faces alight with happiness on the street, in a
car, or wherever they may be—is enough to make
glad a whole gray week. Though to be sure no week
is ever wholly gray.</p>

<p>I was still busy with the sweet surprise of this and
longing for opportunity to tell Pelleas, when they all
moved toward the door and with good-byes filed
into the hall. And there in the anteroom stood
Nichola, our old servant, who brushed my elbow
and said in my ear:—</p>

<p>“Mem, every one of ’em looks starvin’. I’ve a
kettle of hot coffee on the back of the range an’
there’s fresh sponge-cake in plenty. I’ve put cups
on the dinin’-room table, an’ I thought—”</p>

<p>“Nichola!” said I, in a low and I must believe
ecstatic tone.</p>

<p>“An’ no end o’ work it’s made me, too,” added our
old servant sourly, and not to be thought in the least
gracious.</p>

<p>It was a very practical ending to that radiant
Easter morning but I dare say we could have devised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
none better. Moreover Nichola had ready sandwiches
and a fresh cheese of her own making, and a
great bowl of some simple salad dressed as only
her Italian hands can dress it. I wondered as I
sat in the circle of our guests, a vase of Easter
lilies on the table, whether Nichola, that grim old
woman who scorned to come to our service, had yet
not brought her pound of ointment of spikenard,
very precious.</p>

<p>“You and Mr. Lovelow are to spend the afternoon
and have tea with us,” I whispered Little Friend, and
had the joy of seeing the tell-tale colour leap gloriously
to her cheek and a tell-tale happiness kindle in
his eyes. I am never free from amazement that a
mere word or so humble a plan for another’s pleasure
can give such joy. Verily, one would suppose that
we would all be so busy at this pastime that we
would almost neglect our duties.</p>

<p>So when the others were gone these two lingered.
All through the long Spring afternoon they sat with
us beside our crackling fire of bavin-sticks, telling
us of this and that homely interest, of some one’s
timid hope and another’s sacrifice, in the life of the
little mission. Ah, I dare say that Carlyle and Hugo
have the master’s hand for touching open a casement
here and there and letting one look in upon an
isolated life, and sympathizing for one passionate
moment turn away before the space is closed again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
with darkness; but these two were destined that day
to give us glimpses not less poignant, to open to us
so many unknown hearts that we would be justified
in never again being occupied with our own concerns.
And when after tea they stood in the dusk of the hall-way
trying to say good-bye, I think that their secret
must have shone in our faces too; and, as the children
say, “we all knew that we all knew,” and life
was a thing of heavenly blessedness.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Lovelow took the hand of Pelleas,
and mine he kissed.</p>

<p>“The Lord bless you, the Lord make his face to
shine upon you, the Lord give you peace,” was in his
eyes as he went away.</p>

<p>“And, O, sir,” Little Friend said shyly to Pelleas
as she stood at the top of the steps, knotting her
crimson muffler, “ain’t it good, after all, that Easter
was all over ice?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night Pelleas carried upstairs a great armful
of the Ascension lilies to stand in the moonlight of
our window. We took lilies to the mantel, and set
stalks of bloom on the table, with their trumpets
turned within upon the room. And when the lower
lights had been extinguished and Nichola had bidden
us her grumbling good-night, we opened the door of
that upper room where the moon was silvering the lilies;
and we stood still, smitten with a common surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said, uncertainly, “O, Pelleas. I
thought—”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Pelleas, with a deep breath.</p>

<p>We bent above the lilies that looked so sweet-scented
and yet had been barren of fragrance because,
we had told ourselves, they seemed flowers of
symbol without mission or message beyond the symbol,
without hue or passion, or, so to say, experience.
(“Perhaps if one were to make some one happy with
them or to put them in a bride’s bouquet they
would no longer be scentless,” Pelleas had quaintly
said.) And now we were certain, as we stood
hushed beside them, that our Easter lilies were giving
out a faint, delicious fragrance.</p>

<p>I looked up at Pelleas almost fearfully in the
flood of Spring moonlight. The radiance was full
on his white hair and tranquil face, and he met
my eyes with the knowledge that we were suddenly
become the custodians of an exquisite secret. The
words of the young servant of God came to me
understandingly.</p>

<p>“‘And the house shall be filled with the odour of
the ointment,’” I said over. “O, Pelleas,” I added,
tremulously, “do you think....”</p>

<p>Pelleas lifted his face and I thought that it shone
in the dimness.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” he answered, “we must believe all the
beautiful things we can.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE MATINÉE</p>

<p>Somewhat later in the Spring Pelleas was obliged
to spend one whole day out of town. He was vastly
important over the circumstance and packed his
bag two days before, which alone proves his advancing
years. For formerly his way had been
to complete his packing in the cab on his way to
the train at that moment pulling from the station.
Now he gave himself an hour to reach the ferry to
allow for being blocked.</p>

<p>“Yes, that alone would prove that we are seventy,”
I said sadly as I stood at the window watching
him drive away.</p>

<p>Yet if ever a good fairy grants you one wish I
advise your wishing that when you are seventy your
heart and some one else’s heart will be as heavy at a
separation as are ours.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I had said to him that morning, “I
wish that every one in the world could love some one
as much as I love you.”</p>

<p>And Pelleas had answered seriously:—</p>

<p>“Remember, Etarre, that every one in the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
who is worth anything either loves as we do or
expects to do so, or else is unhappy because he
doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Not every one?” I remonstrated.</p>

<p>“Every one,” Pelleas repeated firmly.</p>

<p>I wondered about that after he went away. Not
every one, surely. There was, for exception, dear
Hobart Eddy who walked the world alone, loving
every one exactly alike; and there was, for the other
extreme, Nichola, our old servant. She was worth
a very great deal but she loved nobody, not even us;
and I was sure that she prided herself on it. I
could not argue with Pelleas on the eve of a journey
but I harboured the matter against his return.</p>

<p>I was lonely when Pelleas was gone. I was sitting
by the fire with Semiramis on my knee—an Angora
cannot wholly sympathize with you but her aloofness
can persuade you into peace of mind—when the
telephone bell rang. We are so seldom wanted that
the mere ringing of the bell is an event even, as usually
happens, if we are called in mistake. This time,
however, old Nichola, whose tone over the telephone
is like that of all three voices of Cerberus saying “No
admission,” came in to announce that I was wanted
by Miss Wilhelmina Lillieblade. I hurried excitedly
out, for when Miss “Willie” Lillieblade telephones
she has usually either heard some interesting news
or longs to invent some. She is almost seventy as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
well as I. As a girl she was not very interesting,
but I sometimes think that like many other inanimate
objects she has improved with age until now she is
delightful and reminds me of spiced cordials. I never
see a stupid young person without applying the inanimate
object rule and longing to comfort him
with it.</p>

<p>“Etarre,” Miss Willie said, “you and Pelleas
come over for tea this afternoon. I am alone and I
have a lame shoulder.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come with pleasure,” said I readily, “but
Pelleas is away.”</p>

<p>“O,” Miss Willie said without proper regret,
“Pelleas is away.”</p>

<p>For a moment she thought.</p>

<p>“Etarre,” she said, “let’s lunch downtown together
and go to a matinée.”</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my old ears.</p>

<p>“W—we two?” I quavered.</p>

<p>“Certainly!” she confirmed it, “I’ll come in the
coupé at noon.”</p>

<p>I made a faint show of resistance. “What about
your lame shoulder?” I wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Miss Willie, “that will be dead in
a minute and then I won’t know whether it’s lame
or not.”</p>

<p>The next moment she had left the telephone and
I had promised!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>I went upstairs in a delicious flutter of excitement.
When our niece Lisa is with us I watch her go breezily
off to matinées with her young friends, but “matinée”
is to me one of the words that one says often though
they mean very little to one, like “ant-arctic.” I
protest that I felt myself to be as intimate with the
appearance of the New Hebrides as with the ways of
a matinée. I fancy that it was twenty years since
I had seen one. Say what you will, evening theater-going
is far more commonplace; for in the evening
one is frivolous by profession but afternoon frivolity
is stolen fruit. And being a very frivolous old
woman I find that a nibble or so of stolen fruit
leavens the toast and tea. Innocent stolen fruit,
mind you, for heaven forbid that I should prescribe
a diet of dust and ashes.</p>

<p>I had taken from its tissues my lace waist and was
making it splendid with a scrap of lavender velvet
when our old servant brought in fresh candles. She
looked with suspicion on the garment.</p>

<p>“Nichola,” I said guiltily, “I’m going to a
matinée. And you’ll need get no luncheon,” I
hastened to add, “because I’m lunching with Miss
Lillieblade.”</p>

<p>“Yah!” said Nichola, “going to a matinée?”</p>

<p>Nichola says “matiknee,” and she regards a theater
box as among all self-indulgences the unpardonable
sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll have no luncheon to get, Nichola,” I
persuasively reminded her.</p>

<p>Old Nichola clicked the wax candles.</p>

<p>“Me, I’d rather get up lunch for a fambly o’
shepherds,” she grimly assured me, “than to hev you
lose your immortal soul at this late day.”</p>

<p>She went back to the kitchen and I was minded
to take off the lavender velvet; but I did not do so,
my religion being independent of the spectrum.</p>

<p>At noon Nichola was in the drawing-room fastening
my gaiters when Miss Lillieblade came in, erect
as a little brown and white toy with a chocolate
cloak and a frosting hood.</p>

<p>“We are going to see ‘The End of the World,’” said
Miss Willie blithely,—“I knew you haven’t seen it,
Etarre.”</p>

<p>Old Nichola, who is so privileged that she will
expect polite attention even on her death-bed, listened
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Is it somethin’ of a religious play, mem?” she
hopefully inquired.</p>

<p>“I dare say, Nichola,” replied Miss Willie kindly;
and afterward, to me: “But I hope not. Religious
plays are so ungodly.”</p>

<p>Her footman helped us down the steps, not by any
means that we required it but for what does one pay
a footman I would like to ask? And we drove away
to a little place which I cannot call a café. I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
as readily lunch at a ribbon-counter as in a café. But
this was a little place where Pelleas and I often had
our tea, a place that was all of old rugs and old brasses
in front, and in secret was set with tête-à-tête tables
having each one rose and one shaded candle. The
linen was what a café would call lace and the china
may have been china or it may have been garlands
and love-knots. From where I sat I could see
shelves filled with home-made jam, labeled, like
library-books, and looking far more attractive than
some peoples’ libraries. We ordered tea and chicken-broth
and toast and a salad and, because we had
both been forbidden, a sweet. I am bound to say
that neither of us ate the sweet but we pretended
not to notice.</p>

<p>We talked about the old days—this is no sign
of old age but rather of a good memory; and presently
I was reminded of what Pelleas had assured me
that morning about love.</p>

<p>“Where did you go to school?” Miss Willie had
been asking me.</p>

<p>“At Miss Mink’s and Miss Burdick’s,” I answered,
“and I was counting up the other day that if either
of them is alive now she is about one hundred and
five years old and in the newspapers on her birthday.”</p>

<p>“Miss Mink and Miss Burdick alive now,” Miss
Willie repeated. “No, indeed. They would rather
die than be alive now. They would call it proof of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
ill-breeding not to die at threescore and ten each
according to rule. I went to Miss Trelawney’s.
I had an old aunt who had brought me up to say
‘Ma’am?’ when I failed to understand; but if I
said ‘Ma’am?’ in school, Miss Trelawney made me
learn twenty lines of Dante; and if I <i>didn’t</i> say it at
home I was not allowed to have dessert. Between
the two I loved poetry and had a good digestion and
my education extended no farther.”</p>

<p>“That is quite far enough,” I said. “I don’t know
a better preparation for life than love of poetry and a
good digestion.”</p>

<p>If I could have but one—and yet why should I
take sides and prejudice anybody? Still, Pelleas
had a frightful dyspepsia one winter and it would
have taken forty poets armed to the teeth—but I
really refuse to prejudice anybody.</p>

<p>Then I told Miss Willie how at Miss Mink’s and
Miss Burdick’s I had had my first note from a <i>boy</i>;
I slept with it under my pillow and I forgot it and the
maid carried it to Miss Mink, and I blush to recall
that I appeared before that lady with the defense that
according to poetry my note was worth more than her
entire curriculum, and triumphantly referred her to
“Summum Bonum.” She sent me home, I recall.
And then Miss Willie told how having successfully
evaded chapel one winter evening at Miss Trelawney’s
she had waked in the night with the certainty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
that she had lost her soul in consequence and, unable
to rid herself of the conviction, she had risen and
gone barefoot through the icy halls to the chapel
and there had been horrified to find old Miss Trelawney
kneeling with a man’s photograph in her
hands.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange, Etarre,” said Miss Willie, “how
the little mysteries and surprises of loving some one
are everywhere, from one’s first note from a <i>boy</i> to
the Miss Trelawneys whom every one knows?”</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that it is almost impudent to
wonder about one’s friends when one is certain beyond
wondering that they all have secret places in
their hearts filled with delight and tears. But
remembering what Pelleas had said that morning I
did wonder about Miss Willie, since I knew that for
all her air of spiced cordial she was lonely; and yet
mentally I placed Miss Willie beside old Nichola and
Hobart Eddy, intending to use all three as instances
to crush the argument of Pelleas. Surely of all the
world, I decided, those three loved nobody.</p>

<p>At last we left the pleasant table, nodding good-afternoon
to the Cap and Ribbons who had been
cut from a coloured print to serve us. We lingered
among the brasses and the casts, feeling very humble
before the proprietor who looked like a duchess
cut from another coloured print. I envied her that
library of jelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>On the street Miss Willie bought us each a rose
for company and then bade the coachman drive
slowly so that we entered the theater with the orchestra,
which is the only proper moment. If one is
earlier one feels as if one looked ridiculously expectant;
if one is later one misses the pleasure of being
expectant at all. We were in a lower stage box
and all the other boxes were filled with bouquets of
young people, with a dry stalk or two magnificently
bonneted set stiffly among them. I hope that we
did not seem too absurd, Miss Willie and I with our
bobbing white curls all alone in that plump crimson
box.</p>

<p>“The End of the World” proved to be a fresh,
happy play, fragrant of lavender and sweet air. The
play was about a man and a woman who loved each
other very much with no analyses or confessions to
disturb any one. The blinds were open and the sun
streamed in through four acts of pleasant humour
and quick action among well-bred people who manifestly
had been brought up to marry and give in
marriage without trying to compete with a state where
neither is done. In the fourth act the moon shone
on a little châlet in the leaves and one saw that there
are love and sacrifice and good will enough to carry
on the world in spite of its other connections. It was
a play which made me thankful that Pelleas and I
have clung to each other through society and poverty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
and dyspepsia and never have allied ourselves with
the other side. And if any one thinks that there is
a middle ground I, who am seventy, know far better.</p>

<p>Now in the third act it chanced that the mother
of the play, so to speak, at the height of her ambition
that her daughter marry a fortune as she herself had
done, opened an old desk and came upon a photograph
of the love of her own youth, whom she had
not married. That was a sufficiently hackneyed
situation, and the question that smote the mother
must be one that is beating in very many hearts that
give no sign; for she had truly loved this boy
and he had died constant to her. And the
woman prayed that when she died she might
“go back and be with him.” Personally, being
a very hard and unforgiving old woman, I
had little patience with her; and besides I think
better of heaven than to believe in any such necessity.
Still this may be because Pelleas and I
are certain that we will belong to each other when
we die. Perhaps if I had not married him—but
then I did.</p>

<p>Hardly had the curtain fallen when to my amazement
Miss Willie Lillieblade leaned forward with
this:—</p>

<p>“Etarre, do you believe that those who truly love
each other here are going to know each other when
they die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly!” I cried, fearing the very box would
crumble at the heresy of that doubt.</p>

<p>“No matter how long after ...” she said wistfully.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of difference,” I returned positively.</p>

<p>“You and Pelleas can be surer than most,” Miss
Willie said reflectively, “but suppose one of you had
died fifty years ago. Would you be so sure?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” I replied, “Pelleas was always
Pelleas.”</p>

<p>“So he was,” Miss Willie assented and was silent
for a little; and then, without warning:—</p>

<p>“Etarre, I mean this,” she said, speaking rapidly
and not meeting my eyes. “When I was twenty I
met a boy a little older than I, and I had known him
only a few months when he went abroad to join his
father. Before he went—he told me that he loved
me—” it was like seeing jonquils bloom in snow to
hear Miss Willie say this—“and I know that I
loved him. But I did not go with him—he wanted
me to go and I did not go with him—for stupid
reasons. He was killed on a mountain in Switzerland.
And I wonder and wonder—you see that
was fifty years ago,” said Miss Willie, “but I wonder....”</p>

<p>I sat up very straight, hardly daring to look at her.
All you young people who talk with such pretty
concern of love, do you know what it will be when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
you are seventy to come suddenly on one of these
flowers, still fresh, which you toss about you now?</p>

<p>“Since he died loving you and you have loved him
all these years,” I said, trying to keep my voice
steady, “never tell me that you will not be each other’s—afterward.”</p>

<p>And at least no one need gainsay this who is not
prepared to prove the contrary.</p>

<p>“But where—where?” cried Miss Willie, poor
little Miss Willie, echoing the cry of every one in the
world. It was very strange to see this little vial of
spiced cordial wondering about the immortality of
love.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where or how,” I said, “but believe
it and you’ll see.”</p>

<p>Ah, how I reproached myself later to think that
I could have said no more than that. Many a fine
response that I might have made I compounded
afterward, all about love that is infinite and eternal
so that it fills the universe and one cannot get beyond
it, and so on, in long phrases; but there in that box
not one other word could I say. And yet when one
thinks of it what is there to say when one is asked
about this save simply: “I don’t know how or where,
but believe it and you’ll see.”</p>

<p>We said little else, and I sat there with all that
company of blue and pink waists dancing about me
through a mist in a fashion that would have astonished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
them. So much for Miss Willie as an
instance in my forthcoming argument with Pelleas
about every one in the world loving some one. Miss
Willie had gone over to his side of the case outright.
I began to doubt that there would be an argument.
Still, there would always be Hobart Eddy, inalienably
on my side and serenely loving every one alike. And
there would always be Nichola, loving nobody. If
all the world fell in love and went quite mad, there
would yet be Nichola fluting her “Yah!” to any
such fancy.</p>

<p>I dare say that neither Miss Willie nor I heard
very much of that last act in spite of its moonlit châlet
among the leaves. But one picture I carried away
with me and the sound of one voice. They were
those of a girl, a very happy girl, waiting at the
door of the châlet.</p>

<p>“Dear,” she said to her sweetheart, “if we had
never met, if we had never seen each other, it seems
as if my love for you would have followed you without
my knowing. Maybe some day you would have
heard it knocking at your heart, and you would have
called it a wish or a dream.”</p>

<p>Afterward I recalled that I was saying over those
words as we made our way up the aisle.</p>

<p>We were almost the last to leave the theater. I like
that final glimpse of a place where happy people
have just been. We found the coupé and a frantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
carriageman put us in, very gently, though he banged
the door in that fashion which seems to be the only
outlet to a carriageman’s emotions.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Miss Willie Lillieblade at
my door, and gave my hand an unwonted lingering
touch. I knew why. Dear, starved heart, she
must have longed for years to talk about that boy.
I watched her coupé roll toward the great lonely
house. Never tell me that the boy who died in
Switzerland was not beside her hearth waiting her
coming.</p>

<p>Our drawing-room was dimly lighted. I took off
my bonnet there and found myself longing for my tea.
I am wont to ring for Nichola only upon stately
occasions and certainly not at times when in her
eyes I tremble on the brink of “losing my immortal
soul at this late day.” Accordingly I went down to
the kitchen.</p>

<p>I cautiously pushed open the door, for I am frankly
afraid of Nichola who is in everything a frightful
non-conformist. There was no fire on the hearth,
but the bracket lamp was lighted and on a chair
lay Nichola’s best shawl. Nichola, in her best
black frock and wearing her best bonnet, was just
arranging the tea-things on a tray.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that you’ve been out, Nichola,” said I
gently—as gently as a truant child, I fancy!—“It
is such a beautiful day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“Who,” Nichola said grimly without looking at
me, “said I’d been out?”</p>

<p>“Why, I saw you—” I began.</p>

<p>“Where was I?” Nichola demanded shrilly,
whirling about.</p>

<p>“I saw you with your bonnet on,” said I, and
added with dignity, “You may bring the tea up at
once, and mind that there is plenty of hot water.”</p>

<p>Then I scurried upstairs, my heart beating at my
daring. I had actually ordered Nichola about. I
half expected that in consequence she would bring
me cold water, but she came up quietly enough
with some delicious tea and sandwiches. At the
door, with unwonted meekness, she asked me if
everything was right; and I, not abating one jot of
my majesty, told her that there might be a bit more
cream. She even brought that and left me marveling.
I could as easily imagine the kitchen range
with an emotion as Nichola with a guilty conscience,
and yet sometimes I have a guilty conscience myself
and I always act first very self-sufficient and then very
humble, just like Nichola.</p>

<p>When she was handing the dessert that night at my
solitary dinner, she spoke; and if the kitchen range
had kissed a hand at me I should not have been more
amazed.</p>

<p>“Every one took their parts very well this afternoon,
I thought,” she stiffly volunteered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>I looked at her blankly. Then slowly it dawned
for me: The best shawl, the guilty conscience—Nichola
had been to the matinée!</p>

<p>“Nichola!” I said unguardedly. “Were you—”</p>

<p>“Certain,” she said curtly, “I ain’t no call
to be no more careful o’ my soul than what you
are.”</p>

<p>I, the keeper of Nichola, who has bullied Pelleas
and me about for years!</p>

<p>“Did—did you like it, Nichola?” I asked
doubtfully, a little unaware how to treat a discussion
of original sin like this.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” she replied unexpectedly. “But—do
you believe all of it?”</p>

<p>“Believe that it really happened?” I asked in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“No,” said Nichola, catching up a corner of
the table-cloth in her brown fingers; “believe what
she said—in the door there?”</p>

<p>It came to me then dimly, but before I could tell
or remember....</p>

<p>“That about ‘If we hadn’t never met,’” Nichola
quoted; “‘it sorter seems as though my love would
’a’ followed you up even if I didn’t know about it an’
mebbe you’d ’a’ heard it somewheres an’ ’a’ thought
you was a-wishin’ or a-dreamin’—’ that part,” said
Nichola.</p>

<p>And then I understood—I understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“Nichola,” I said, “yes. I believe it with all my
heart. I know it is so!”</p>

<p>Nichola looked at me wistfully.</p>

<p>“But wishin’ may be just wishin’,” she said, “an’
dreamin’ nights may be just dreamin’ nights—”</p>

<p>“Never,” I cried positively. “Most of the time
these are voices of the people who would have loved
us if we had ever met.”</p>

<p>Old Nichola’s face, with its little unremembering
eyes beneath her gray moss hair, seldom changes
expression save to look angry. I think that
Nichola, like the carriageman slamming the doors,
relieves all emotion by anger. When I die I expect
that in proof of her grief she will drive every one out
of the house with the broom. Therefore I was not
surprised to see her look at me now with a sudden
frown and flush that should have terrorized me.</p>

<p>“Heaven over us!” she said, turning abruptly.
“The silly folks that dream. I never dreamed a
thing in my life. Do you want more pudding-sauce?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said gently, “no, Nichola.”</p>

<p>I was not deceived. Nichola knew it, and went
in the pantry, muttering. But I was not deceived.
I knew what she had meant. Nichola, that old
woman whose life had some way been cast up on
this barren coast near the citadel of the love of Pelleas
and me; Nichola, who had lived lonely in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
grim company of the duties of a household not her
own; Nichola, at more than sixty, was welcoming the
belief that the love which she never had inspired was
some way about her all the time.</p>

<p>Where was my side of the argument to be held
with Pelleas? Where, indeed? But I was glad to
see it go. And I serenely put away until another
time the case of Hobart Eddy.</p>

<p>All the evening I sat quietly before the hearth.
There was no need for books. The drawing-room
was warm and bright; supper for Pelleas was drawn
to the open fire and my rose was on the tray. When
I heard him close the front door it seemed to me that
I must welcome him for us three, for Miss Willie
and Nichola and me.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE PATH OF IN-THE-SPRING</p>

<p>The case of Hobart Eddy had always interested
us,—dear Hobart Eddy with whom matters stood like
this: Heaven had manifestly intended him to be a
Young Husband, and yet he was thirty-five and walked
the world alone.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I were wont to talk of him before our
drawing-room fire. Hobart Eddy, we were agreed,
was one of the men who look like a young husband.
By that I cannot in the least explain what I mean,
but he was wont to bend above a book or lean toward
a picture exactly as another man would say: “And
how are you to-day, dear?” If he were to have entered
a coach in which I was traveling I think that
I should involuntarily have looked about for some
girlish face to be lighting at his coming. Therefore
we two had been wont to amuse ourselves by picturing,
but without much hope, his possible wife; she
must be so many things to him that we found it
difficult to select any one in whom to rest our expectation,
faint yet persistent. Though I knew no one
save Pelleas himself who would have been as a lover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
so adorable, as a husband so tender, the problem
was not quite so simple; for Hobart Eddy was a
king of the social hour and a ruler of many.</p>

<p>“The allegro, quite the allegro of my dinner symphony,”
Miss Willie Lillieblade had once thankfully
flattered him. “Ah, you were more. You were
the absolute conductor. You were the salvation of
our tempo during the entrée. The dear Bishop,
who thought he was the religious theme for the trombones,
how you quieted his ecclesiastical chantings.
How you modulated the sputterings of that French
horn of a count. And ah, my dear Hobart, how you
obeyed my anxious <i>sforzando</i> over my mute little
guest of honour. I’ve no <i>beaux yeux</i> to look you
thanks, but I appreciated every breath of your
baton.”</p>

<p>Thus, with his own charm, Hobart Eddy was one
whom it was a simple thing to adore; and as Pelleas
said with twinkling cruelty débutantes are dear,
simple things. But among them all season after
season Hobart moved, boyishly interested, urbanely
ready as we thought to do the homage of the
devotee and, one might have said, urbanely unable.
And season after season we had failed to plan for
him a concrete romance. For we thought that
his wife should be no less than he a social ruler
of many, yet she must have his own detached heart
of youth. Moreover, we wished her to be clever, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
not to every one; and wise, though with a pretty
unreason; and girlishly unconscious, or if she was
conscious then just conscious enough; and very
willing to be ordered about a bit, though losing
none of her pretty imperiousness—ah well, no
wonder the case of Hobart Eddy baffled us. No
wonder that I believed him hopeless as I had
believed Nichola, who loves no one. We should
long ago have laid the matter by if only there had
not persisted about him that Devoted Young Husband
look.</p>

<p>It was in the week made memorable both by our
Easter day experience and by the moral of my matinée
that our thought momentarily took up the case
of Hobart Eddy in earnest. Indeed, our Easter
day and my matinée did much to shape our Summer.
For on a sudden it seemed so easy to make happiness
in the world as well as to look close and read the fine
print of romance that we found ourselves with almost
no leisure. And in that very week Viola unexpectedly
came home from school.</p>

<p>Viola is a niece of my dear Madame Sally Chartres
and the previous Spring she had nominally spent
a week with Pelleas and me. I say nominally because
in reality she had spent it before the telephone
on our landing.</p>

<p>“Viola, who,” Pelleas had been wont to say,
“sounds like a Greek maiden captive in an Illyrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
household and beloved of a Greek youth, <i>Telephone</i>,
in four syllables.”</p>

<p>He was a young bank clerk in Broad street and he
seemed to have a theory that whenever any one else
had used the telephone Viola was no longer at the
other end, and he was obliged to make sure. “Miss
Viola, the telephone wants to talk to you,” Nichola
had announced all day long. And though Pelleas
and I are the first to love a lover, some way the case
failed to impress us to partisanship—just as we lose
sympathy with the influenza of a man who is perpetually
shutting the car door.</p>

<p>“If I were a telephone,” Pelleas would say, “intended
by Science for uses of medicine, bonds and
the like I should get out of order if they tried to make
me a courtier.”</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I had justly protested, “you would be
the first to be delighted.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” he admitted, “I dare say I should, but
then you see I know so little about science.”</p>

<p>When that Summer it was decided that Viola
should complete her school in Switzerland, Pelleas
and I understood that the Chartres family sympathized
with our own impression about our telephone.
But before the end of the year Viola unexpectedly
returned from Lausanne. And the April day on
which we learned of this from Hobart Eddy was
further memorable to us: For it was on that very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
morning that the first rose-breasted grosbeaks appeared
in the park.</p>

<p>West of the walk leading from the south to the
Reservoir Castle in the park there is a little brick
path, steep and uneven and running crookedly downward
like a mere mood of the sober walk itself. The
path is railed in from the crowding green things on
either side, but the rail hardly thwarts a magnificent
Forsythia which tosses its sprays to curve high over
the way like the curve of wings in flight. It was a
habit of ours to seek out this path once or twice every
Spring and to stand beneath these branches. Some
way when we did that we were <i>sure</i> that it was Spring,
for we seemed to catch its high moment; as for
another a bell might strike somewhere with “One,
two, three: Now it is the crest of May. Four, five,
six: Now this apple-tree is at the very height of its
bloom. This is <i>the moment</i> of this rose.” We called
this path the path of In-the-Spring. We always
went there in the mornings, for in Spring we think
that it seems to be <i>more</i> Spring in the morning than
in the afternoon. And it was here of an April Nine-o’clock
that we saw our first pair of grosbeaks of the
year.</p>

<p>They alighted quite close to us as if for them we
were not there. They were on some pleasant business
of testing the flavour of buds and the proud,
rose-throated male, vibrating his wings the while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
gave us his note as if he were the key to the whole
matter. And I think that he was .. .—.....⌒⌒.—.—?
he imparted, and it was like revelation and
prophecy and belief; so that for a moment we were
near knowing what he meant and what he is and
what we and the Forsythia are. But the information
escaped us and the grosbeaks flew away. However,
they left us their blessing. For there was a little glow
in our hearts at having been so near.</p>

<p>“Now,” Pelleas said as we mounted the steep
path back to the real walk (so innocently absorbed
the real walk looked and as if it knew nothing at all
about its gay little aberration of a path!). “Now,
that must mean something.”</p>

<p>“Of course it must,” said I contentedly. “What
must, Pelleas?”</p>

<p>He answered solemnly: That when a bird or a
child or a wood-creature shows you confidence it
always indicates that something pleasant is about
to happen. I detected his mood of improvisation;
but who am I to dissent from an improvisation so
satisfying?</p>

<p>We sat on the first bench and Pelleas drew out
our March-April record. In a little town of the West
which we know and love there is kept each Spring
on the bulletin board of the public library a list of
dates of the return of the migratory birds with the
names of those who first saw and reported them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and there is the pleasantest rivalry among the citizens
to determine who shall announce the earliest
appearances. From time to time through the Spring
this list is printed in the daily newspaper. Since we
knew of this beautiful custom Pelleas and I have
always made a list, for Spring. That day our record
read:—</p>

<p>“It sounds like a programme of music,” I said.</p>

<p>“All lists are wonderful things,” said Pelleas,
folding ours away in his portmonnaie; “one ought
to ‘keep’ a great many.”</p>

<p>I did not at once agree. To be sure I believe passionately
in lists of birds; but in the main I profess
for lists a profound indifference. As for “keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
a diary” I would as soon describe a walk in the
woods by telling the number of steps I had taken.</p>

<p>“One cannot make a list of the glory of a thing,”
I ventured at last.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” Pelleas admitted. “If only one
could what a talisman it would be to take out and
read, on one’s worst days.”</p>

<p>It would indeed. But I suppose that one’s list
of Spring birds would help one on such a day if one
would, so to speak, read deep down into the page.</p>

<p>“We might make a ‘Bird List: Part Two,’”
Pelleas suggested, “for that kind of thing.”</p>

<p>“But how could one?” I objected; “for example:
‘<i>April 29th—Rose-breasted grosbeak day. A momentary
knowledge that there is more about a bird
and about what he is and about what we are than one
commonly supposes.</i>’ You see, Pelleas, how absurd
that would be.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” he protested stoutly, “one needn’t
try to write it out in words. One could merely
indicate it. Just that would help one to keep alive
the thrill of a thing. Such a device would be very
dear to every one.”</p>

<p>That is true. To keep alive the thrill of a thing,
of revelation, of prophecy, of belief—we all go asking
how to do that.</p>

<p>“I dare say though,” Pelleas said, “that one could
keep it alive by merely passing it on. The point is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
to keep such moments <i>alive</i>. Not necessarily to
keep them for one’s own.”</p>

<p>To keep alive the thrill of that moment when we
had seen the grosbeaks, the high moment of a
Spring morning; not to know these little ecstasies
briefly, but to abide in their essential peace; is this
not as if one were arbiter of certain modes of immortality?</p>

<p>“Surely that would make one a ‘restorer of paths
to dwell in,’” he added.</p>

<p>“A restorer of the path of In-the-Spring,” I said.</p>

<p>Pelleas turned the glasses on the magnolias. “On
my soul,” he exclaimed, “I thought I saw a tanager!”
And when we had stood for a moment to watch hopefully
and had been disappointed (“Why shouldn’t
an early tanager come, to help us to believe?” he
wondered), he gave a vital spark to what I had said
about the path:—</p>

<p>“I suppose that that little path really has no
ending,” he said; “you cannot end direction. Yes,
the path of In-the-Spring must run right away to the
end of the world.”</p>

<p>We walked on happily, counting the robins, listening
to a near phœbe call to a far phœbe, watching
two wrens pull slivers from a post for a nest they
knew. Across the green, but too far away for certainty,
we thought we saw a cherry bough in flower.
.. .— ..... .⌒⌒ .—? we heard the grosbeak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
once again from somewhere invisible. The
mornings on which we walk in the park seem to us
almost like youth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The augury that something pleasant was about
to happen was further fulfilled when we came in
sight of our house and saw Hobart Eddy’s great
appalling French touring car like an elephant kneeling
at our curb. Hobart was waiting for us in the
drawing-room and he stood before us looking down
from his splendid height and getting his own way
from the first.</p>

<p>“Come, Aunt Etarre,” he said, “there is no car
like her. I want you both to run over to Inglese
to see Viola. You knew that she has come home?”</p>

<p>“Viola—has she really?” I cried; and, “Have
you seen her?” asked Pelleas; and, “How does
she look?” we demanded together.</p>

<p>“No,” Hobart said, “I’ve not seen her. I had
a charming little note from her, full of nods. Now
that I think of it,” he went on leisurely, “Viola’s
charming little letters are always very like a bow
from her. She never even waves her hand in them.
She merely bows, in ink. I think I shall point out
to her that if ever she is too busy to write letters she
might send about her handkerchiefs, instead. One
would tell quite as much as the other, and both
suggest orris....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Hobart Eddy,” I begged impatiently, “where is
Viola?”</p>

<p>“She is in Inglese-in-the-valley, with the Chartres,”
he told me. “Get your bonnet, dear, and a tremendous
veil and come. I’ll run like a tortoise-shell and
you shall toot the horn.”</p>

<p>I turned tremblingly to Pelleas for I had never
been in a motor car. Lumbering electric hansoms
and victorias had borne me, but the kneeling elephant
was another matter. But Pelleas, being a man, is
no more in awe of machinery than I am of chiffons;
or than he is of chiffons; and he assented to Inglese
quite simply.</p>

<p>“Very well, Hobart Eddy,” I said, “I will go.
You are charming to want us. But bear in mind
that I reserve the right to insist that you are running
too fast, block by block. And if anything goes
wrong very likely I shall catch at the brake.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lead the thing by the bridle if you say so,” he
promised faithfully.</p>

<p>Presently we were free of the avenue, skimming
the park, threading our way among an hundred
excitements, <i>en route</i> to Inglese. Hobart Eddy
was driving the machine himself and as I looked at
his shoulders I found to my amazement that I was
feeling a certain confidence. Hobart Eddy was one
of the men whose shoulders—ah, well, it is among the
hardships of life that one’s best reasons are never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
communicable. But I was feeling a certain confidence.
And though a little alarm remained to
prove me conservative I found myself also diverted.
I remember trying when I was a child to determine
at night in a thunder-storm which of me was frightened
and which was sleepy and deciding that some
of me was sleepy but all of me was frightened.
And now, having come to a time of life when some
terror should be a diversion, all of me was diverted
though some of me was terrified. Hobart was running
very slowly and glancing back at me now and
then to nod reassuringly. The very sun was reassuring.
The river and the Long Island ferry were
reassuring. On such a day certainty is as easy as
song. And by the time that we had reached the
hills about Inglese I could have found it in my heart
to telephone to Pelleas if he had been a block away:
What a day. I love you.</p>

<p>Instead I sat quietly in the tonneau when, on the
outskirts of the village, Hobart drew the car to the
green crest of a little height. I found that the
tonneau was geometrically in the one precise spot
from which through pine- and fir-trees a look of the
sea unrolled. Hobart is a perfect host and is always
constructing these little altars to the inessential.
On a journey Pelleas and he would remember to
look out for the “view” as another man would think
of trunk checks. But Pelleas and Hobart would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
remember trunk checks too and it is this combination
which holds a woman captive.</p>

<p>“And down there,” said Hobart, looking the other
way, “will be Viola of Inglese-in-the-valley. It
sounds like an aria.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” Pelleas observed on this, “whether
Viola is still in love with our telephone. If I thought
she was I should certainly take it out. I have
never,” Pelleas added conscientiously, “taken one
out. But I think I could. I’ve often thought I
could. And that should do for him—that young
Greek youth <i>Telephone</i>.”</p>

<p>“Her little nod of a letter,” said Hobart, “seemed
very content. So content that either she must have
forgotten all about your telephone or else she had
him at her elbow. They say there are those two
routes to content.”</p>

<p>Had Hobart himself found that first route, I
wondered. For some years now we had seen him
merely sitting out operas, handing tea, leading cotillons,
and returning fans—urbane, complaisant,
perfectly the social automaton. But always we had
patiently hoped for him something gracious. Instead,
had he merely found the content of some
Forgetting? And if this was so he was in case still
more sad than if he were unhappy. Either possibility
grieved me. I am not unskillful with my
needle and I found myself oddly longing to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
to bear my embroidery silks and cottons upon
Hobart Eddy’s life. If only I might have embroidered
on it a pattern of rosemary or heart’s-ease—ay,
or even the rue.</p>

<p>And suddenly I grasped the real situation. Here
was Hobart for whom we longed to plan a concrete
romance. And over there, in Inglese, was
Viola come home again, grown wiser, more beautiful,
and I had no doubt remaining as wholly lovable as
before. And did I not know how willingly Madame
Sally Chartres would have trusted the future of her
little grandniece to Hobart Eddy? Was I not, in
fact, in the secret of certain perfectly permissible
ideas of Madame Sally’s on the subject? Not plans,
but ideas. Moreover, now that Viola was back in
America there was once more the peril of that young
<i>Telephone</i>. And if Pelleas and I had devised the
matter we could have thought of no lady lovelier
than Viola. I turned to telegraph to Pelleas and I
found him in the midst of the merest glance at me.
It was one of the glances which need no spelling.
And it was in that moment as if between us there had
been spoken our universal and unqualified, <i>Why not?</i></p>

<p>“Hobart,” said I, “you are very brave to go to
Inglese. I have always thought that any man
could fall in love with a woman named Viola.”</p>

<p>But as for Hobart he serenely took one of the side
paths which he is so fond of developing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said reflectively, “Viola begins
with a V. I’m a bit afraid of V. V—‘the viol, the
violet, and the vine.’ V sounds,” he continued, as if
he enjoyed it, “such an impractical letter—a kind
of apotheosis of B. Wouldn’t one say that V is a
sort of poet to the alphabet? None of the sturdiness
of G—or the tranquillity of M—or the piquancy
of K—or the all-round usefulness of E. I
don’t know, really, whether a woman who begins
with V could be taken seriously. I think I should
feel as if I were married to a wreath, or a lyre.”</p>

<p>Any one save Pelleas and me would have been
discouraged, but we are more than seventy years
old and we understand the value of the quality of
a man’s indifference. Moreover, we believed that
Hobart had a heart both cold and hot but that the
cold side is always turned toward the sun.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said I, “but Viola Chartres is another
matter. She makes one <i>wish</i> to fall in love with a
wreath, or a lyre.”</p>

<p>“A man always ought,” Hobart impersonally
continued, “to marry a woman named Elizabeth
Strong Davis or the like. Something that sounds
primal—and finished. A sort of ballast-and-anchor
name that one might say over in exigencies, like
a golden text.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, now, I don’t know,” Pelleas submitted
mildly, “‘Etarre’ sounds like Camelot and Astolat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and Avalon and so on to any number of unrealities.
But it seems like a golden text to me.”</p>

<p>I wonder that I could pursue my fixed purpose,
that was so charming to hear. Perhaps it is that I
have partly learned to keep a purpose through
charming things as well as through difficulties, though
this is twofold as hard to do.</p>

<p>“Women’s names are wonderful things,” Hobart
Eddy was going tranquilly on. “They seem to be
alive—to have life on their own account. I can
say over a name—or I think I could say over a
name,” he corrected it, “to myself, and aloud, until
it seemed Somebody there with me.”</p>

<p>I looked at him swiftly. Did he mean that there
was for him some such name? Or did he merely
mean that he might mean something, other things
being equal?</p>

<p>“That would be a good test,” he added, “for
one who couldn’t make up his mind whether he
was in love. And it would be a new and decorative
branch of phonology. Why doesn’t phonology,”
he inquired reasonably, “take up some of these
wonderful things instead of harking back to beginnings?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said I tenaciously, “and Viola—”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Who is Viola? What is she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That all our swains commend her?’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>he adapted, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve wondered,” said I gravely, “that you
haven’t asked that of yourself before.”</p>

<p>But having now effectually introduced the matter
I looked about me helplessly. What were we to
say to Hobart Eddy? To have embroidered a
message with silks and cottons would have been
a simple matter; but it is difficult to speak heart’s-ease
and rue. Moreover, it is absurd to impart
one’s theory of life without an invitation. Sometimes
even by invitation it is absurd. If only
one might embroider it, now! Or if one might
merely indicate it, as Pelleas had said of the “Bird
Book: Part Two,” for keeping alive the thrill of
a thing....</p>

<p>At that our morning was back upon me, with
its moment that was like revelation and prophecy
and belief. Yet how to give to Hobart Eddy in
effect: <i>A momentary knowledge that there is more
about a bird and about what he is and about what we
are than one commonly supposes.</i> How to tell him
that some gracious purpose—like winning the love
of Viola—would teach the secret? I longed unspeakably,
and so, I know, did Pelleas, to be to him
a “restorer of paths to dwell in”—a restorer of
the path of In-the-Spring which we feared that he
had long lost. Though, indeed, how should one
ever lose that path which runs to the end of the
world? I looked at Pelleas and surprised him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the midst of the merest glance at me. And when
he spoke I knew that he understood.</p>

<p>“Hobart,” said he, “the grosbeaks are here. We
saw them this morning.”</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy nodded with an air of polite concern.
“The Grosbeaks?” he said over, uncertainly. “Do—do
I know them? I am so deuced forgetful.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, now,” said Pelleas, “I don’t know that
they are on your list. But you are on theirs, if you
care to be. I suggest that you make their acquaintance.
They’re birds.”</p>

<p>Hobart looked startled. But Pelleas enjoys as
much as any one being momentarily misunderstood
and he smiled back at Hobart as if he were proud
of his idiom.</p>

<p>“I must get you to present me,” Hobart seriously
murmured.</p>

<p>“Do,” Pelleas said with enjoyment. “Come
over in the park with us any day now—though May
and June are rather better. I never knew them
come up from the South so early. Splendid family
and all that,” Pelleas added; “<i>Zamelodia Ludoviciana</i>,
you know. Charming connections.”</p>

<p>“O, I say,” said Hobart, “what a jolly idiot I
am! I thought you were in earnest, you know.”</p>

<p>“I never was more in earnest in my life,” Pelleas
protested. “You really must see them. Little brown
lady-bird with her gold under her wings. Male<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
with a glorious rose all over his breast and a song—Hobart,
you should hear his song. It’s a little like
a robin’s song, but all trilled out and tucked in
and done in doubles and triplets and burrs—and
a question at the end. You never heard one sing at
night? You never went over in the park or out in
the country to hear them sing at night? Etarre—do
show him how it goes.”</p>

<p>I have a fancy for singing the bird notes that we
love and Pelleas, who could as easily hem a thing
as to sing it, will in Spring keep me all hours at this
pastime. Once he woke me in the night to reclaim
the song of the orchard oriole—and next morning
Nichola sorely discomfited me by observing that long
after midnight she had heard owls in the chimney.
But we persist in the delight and so now I sang for
Hobart the song of the grosbeak:—</p>

<p class="center x-ebookmaker-drop">
[<a href="music/071music.mp3">Listen</a>]
[<a href="music/071music.mid">MIDI</a>]
[<a href="music/071music.mxl">XML</a>]
</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe20" id="music">
  <img class="w100" src="images/music.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“it goes,” said I, “but the next one you hear may be
quite—quite different! There is no tune to the
song, ever—but exquisite rhythm. O, and such
arch anxiety he is in, Hobart; you cannot think.
And when he is done you’ve got to believe the way
he does because of his little question which is never
‘Do you think?’ but always ‘Don’t you think?’
Fancy your never having heard him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“I say, you know,” said Hobart, enthusiastically,
“I’d like to hear him, most awfully.”</p>

<p>“O you would—you would,” I agreed, and
could say no more. In Spring my heart is always
aching for the busy and the self-absorbed who do
not seize opera glasses and post away to some place
of trees.</p>

<p>Pelleas was fumbling in his portmonnaie.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said beaming; “this is the list
of the birds that we have seen this Spring. And we
have not once stepped outside town, either.”</p>

<p>Hobart took our list and knitted his brows over it.</p>

<p>“I know robins and bluebirds,” he claimed
proudly.</p>

<p>Pelleas nodded. “They are very nearly our dearest,”
he said, “like daisies and buttercups. But we
love the others, too—the rose and orchid and
gardenia birds, Hobart. The grosbeaks and orioles
and tanagers. You can’t think what a pleasure it is
to see them come back one after another, as true
to their dates as the stars—only now and then a bit
earlier, for spice. The society columns in November
are nothing in comparison—though of course they
do very well. Yes, it’s quite like seeing the stars
come back every year. Etarre and I go to the park
after breakfast for the birds and to the roof of the
house after dinner for the stars. March and April
are wonderful months for the constellations.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“O yes,” said Hobart Eddy, “yes. The Great
Dipper and the North star and the Pleiades. I
always know those.”</p>

<p>He was still holding the list, and Pelleas leaned
forward and tapped on it, his face sparkling.</p>

<p>“Hobart,” he said, “give us a day next week.
Let us leave home at six in the morning and get out
in the real country and <i>walk</i> in the fields. We’ll
undertake to show you the birds of this entire list!
The hermit thrushes should be here by then—and I
don’t know but the wood pewees and the orioles, the
season is so early. And of course no end of the
warbler family. We will all take glasses and Etarre
shall give us the bird songs and I dare say we’ll see
some nests. In the middle of the day we’ll hunt
flowers—I could have been certain that I saw violet
columbine a bit back on this road. And by next
week we won’t be able to step for the rue anemone
and the hepatica. You wouldn’t mind not picking
them, Hobart?” asked Pelleas, anxiously. “We’re
rather extreme when it comes to that, and we don’t
pick them, you know. You wouldn’t mind that, I
dare say?”</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy said: No. That he should not mind
that.</p>

<p>“And then after dark we’ll start home,” Pelleas
went on, “but long enough after dark so that we
can walk on some open road and see the stars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Orion will be done for by then,” he recalled frowning.
“Orion and Jupiter are about below the west
by dark even now. But Leo is overhead—and the
Dragon and Cassiopeia in the north—and Spica
and Vega and Arcturus in the east. O, we shall
have friends enough. It is now,” said Pelleas,
“forty-nine years that Etarre and I have watched
for them every year. We began to study them the
Summer that we were married. Forty-nine years
and they have never failed us once. What do you
think of that?”</p>

<p>Hobart folded our list and handed it back.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he said solemnly, “that I
wouldn’t know whether Hepatica was a bird or
a constellation? Jove,” he added, “what a lot of
worlds.”</p>

<p>As for me I sat nodding with all my might. Yes,
what a lot of worlds.</p>

<p>“Will you give us a day, Hobart?” Pelleas repeated.</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” Hobart Eddy said simply.</p>

<p>“We’ll take Viola with us!” I cried then joyfully.
“She knows all these things better than we.”</p>

<p>“She does?” exclaimed Hobart. “At her age? I
believe they have actually begun to educate people
for living,” he observed, “instead of for earning a
living. I dare say lots of people know this kind of
thing—people in cafés and cars and around, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
one never suspects of knowing,” he added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I have sometimes said that of the most
unpromising people: Perhaps after all they know
the birds and wait for the stars to come back. Not
that this would prove them good citizens. But
neither do the most utilitarian faculties prove them so.</p>

<p>“I could fall in love with any woman who was
so accomplished,” said Pelleas, looking at Hobart
and pretending to mean me.</p>

<p>“By Jove, so could I!” said Hobart, looking at
me openly.</p>

<p>“Why, then,” said I at this, meeting his eyes
fairly, “I think that we may as well hurry on to
Inglese.”</p>

<p>He understood, and smiled at us.</p>

<p>“You dear fairy god-people,” he said.</p>

<p>But I hugged our hope as we rolled away; and so,
I know, did Pelleas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No one was on the veranda at the Chartres villa,
and we had seen no one in the grounds save a man
or two working miracles by unwrapping rose-trees.
Madame Sally Chartres, the servant told us, was
gone in the town, and Miss Viola was walking by
the lake. We would not have her summoned and
Hobart, Pelleas, and I went down the slope of early
green to the lake walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>The day was mounting to noon. A Summer day
will miss its high-tide expression because peace falls
on it at noon; but the high noon of Spring is the
very keystone of the bow from sun to sun. I remember
once dreaming of music which grew more
beautiful and came nearer, until I knew as I woke
that I could bear it no longer and that another moment
would have <i>freed</i> me. And,</p>

<p>“Pelleas and Hobart,” I said now, “if to-day gets
any lovelier, I think that none of us can bear it and
that the bubble will burst and we shall be let <i>out</i>.”</p>

<p>For I love to seem a little mad for the sake of the
contrast of my own knowledge that I am sane.</p>

<p>“On a day like this,” said Pelleas, “one hardly
knows whether one is living it or reading it.”</p>

<p>“If we <i>are</i> reading it,” said I, seeming to glance
at Hobart Eddy, “I hope that it will turn out to
be a love story.”</p>

<p>And it did—it did. We followed the curve of the
walk past some flowering bushes and came on a
bench, the kind of bench that rises from the ground
at the mere footfall of two lovers. And there sat
Viola, quite twice as lovely as when she had spent
that week before our telephone on the landing, and
beside her a Boy whose <i>rôle</i> no one who saw his face
could doubt.</p>

<p>She was very lovely as she rose to greet us—indeed,
Viola was one of those who prove the procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of the wild things and the stars to be an
integral part of life. But now for her a new star
had risen whose magnitude was unquestionable.</p>

<p>“Aunt Etarre!” cried Viola. “O, I am so glad to
have you and Uncle Pelleas and Hobart know—<i>first</i>.”</p>

<p>And when she had presented her fine young lover
and I had taken her in my arms, “You know,” she
murmured, “he is your telephone, dear. Do you
remember Uncle Pelleas calling him <i>Telephone</i>?”</p>

<p>Indeed, I do not think that we caught his real name
that morning at all. And as for Pelleas and me, who
are the first to love a lover, we found ourselves instant
partisans of that fine young telephone of ours,
so to speak, now that we finally saw him face to face.
And I remember noting with a reminiscent thrill
that the flowering shrub beneath which we were
standing was Forsythia; and so did Pelleas, who is
delighted with coincidences and hears in them the
<i>motifs</i> of the commonplace.</p>

<p>“I told you this morning, Etarre, that something
pleasant was about to happen,” he said with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“And so it has,” said I happily—and met
Hobart Eddy’s eyes, fixed on mine and quite uncontrollably
dancing.</p>

<p>On which I fell guiltily silent, and so did Pelleas.
It is one of the hardships of life that it is impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
to grieve with the loser and rejoice with the winner
of the same cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When, some time after we five had lunched alone
on the veranda, Viola and Our Telephone waved our
car down the drive, Pelleas and I were not less disposed
to silence. Running slowly through the
grounds Hobart Eddy glanced back at us, and,</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked gravely.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I looked away over the lawns and said
nothing.</p>

<p>“You’ve still got me on your hands, fairy god-people,”
said Hobart, and smiled angelically and
quite without a shadow in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I know,” muttered Pelleas then; “we seem to be
miserable at this kind of thing.”</p>

<p>And it did seem as if the path of In-the-Spring had
eluded us.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a great wrench, Hobart brought the
car to a standstill. “Look! Look there! By Jove,
there it is! Look at it go!” he cried like a boy.
“What is it—O, I say, do you know what it is?”</p>

<p>We, too, had seen it—the joyous rise and curve of
the wing of a scarlet tanager, flashing into flight,
skimming a lawn, burning from the bough of a far
sycamore.</p>

<p>“A tanager!” cried Pelleas and I together, and
caught a moment of its song—its open, double-toned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
two-note and three-note song, a serene cradle melody
borrowed from May.</p>

<p>“O, Jove!” said Hobart Eddy. “Hear him.”</p>

<p>In the reeds by the lake the song sparrows were
singing—we heard these too. But I think that
Pelleas and I heard chiefly another voice which for
the first time Hobart Eddy was hearing.</p>

<p>“What day next week could we go in the country,
do you think?” Hobart asked as he started the car.</p>

<p>“Monday,” suggested Pelleas promptly.</p>

<p>He had out his portmonnaie and the bird list and
I saw what he wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>April 29: Scarlet tanager. Etarre and Hobart and Pelleas.</p>
</div>

<p>And across the page:—</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE ELOPEMENT</p>

<p>The next morning Pelleas and I sat before our
drawing-room fire talking over our amazing trip
to Inglese.</p>

<p>“In that love affair of yesterday,” Pelleas said
sadly, “we were good for absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, now,” I protested feebly, “we chaperoned.”</p>

<p>“Chaperons,” Pelleas said sententiously, “are
nothing, <i>per se</i>. Chaperons are merely the evidence
that everything is not seen.”</p>

<p>“At least,” said I, “that arietta of the <i>Inutile
Precauzione</i> gives great charm to ‘The Barber.’”</p>

<p>“I know,” Pelleas assented; “so does the property
man. But I should like us to be really good for
something on our own account. In some pleasant
affair or other—I don’t greatly care what.”</p>

<p>I looked out the window at New York.</p>

<p>“Think,” said I, “of all the people out there who
are in love and who absolutely <i>need</i> our help.”</p>

<p>“It is shocking,” Pelleas assented gravely. “I
could almost find it in my heart to advertise. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
should we word it? ‘Pelleas and Etarre, Promoters
of Love Stories Unlimited. Office Hours from Time
to Eternity—’”</p>

<p>He broke off smiling, but not at any fancied impracticality.</p>

<p>“Why not?” said I. “The world needs us. You
yourself said that the world is the shape of a dollar
instead of a heart.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m not so sure, though,” Pelleas returned
with an air of confidence. “We don’t know the ways
of the North Pole. Perhaps we shall yet find that
the world <i>is</i> the shape of a heart.”</p>

<p>“At all events,” said I, “we can act as if it were.
And no one now can possibly prove the contrary.”</p>

<p>How would one act if the world were the shape
of a heart? I was considering this seriously when,
five minutes later, I selected with especial care a
book to take to the park. I was going over alone
that morning, for Pelleas was obliged to be downtown.
This happens about three times a year, but
the occasions are very important and Nichola and
I make a vast ado over his departure and we fuss
about until he pretends distraction, though we well
know how flattered he is. Nichola even runs after
him on the street with a newspaper to be read on the
elevated, though we are all three perfectly aware
that even with both pairs of spectacles he cannot
possibly read on the jolting car. But he folds the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
paper and thanks Nichola and, as I believe, sits with
the paper spread before him all the way to Hanover
Square.</p>

<p>On that particular morning Pelleas left very early,
and I arrived in the park when it was not yet a
playground and a place for loitering but a busy causeway
for the first pedestrians. I found a favourite
bench near a wilding mass of Forsythia, with a curve
of walk and a cherry-tree in sight. There I sat with
my closed book—for in the park of a Spring morning
one need never open one’s book providing only
that the book shall have been perfectly selected. I
remember that Pelleas once took down, as he supposed,
a volume of well-beloved essays to carry with
us and when we reached the park we found by accident
that we had brought a doctor’s book instead.
It was such a glad morning that we had not intended
to read, but we were both miserable until Pelleas
went back to exchange it. I cannot tell how we
knew but certain voices refused to sing in the presence
of that musty, fusty volume. When he had
returned with the well-beloved book they all drew
near at once. Therefore we will not go even in the
neighbourhood of the jonquil beds with a stupid
author.</p>

<p>But on this morning of Spring my book was in
tune and all the voices sang, so that they and the sun
and the procession of soft odours almost lulled me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
asleep. You young who wonder why the very dead
do not awake in Spring, let me say that one has only
to be seventy to understand peace even in May.</p>

<p>I was awakened by the last thing which, awake or
asleep, one would expect to hear on such a morning;
a sound which was in fact an act of high treason
to be tried in a court of daffodils. It was a sob.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes with a start, expecting that a
good fairy had planted some seeds which by having
failed to come up on the instant had made her
petulant. The sob, however, proceeded from a
very human Little Nursemaid who sat at the
extreme end of my bench, crying her eyes out.
I could not see her face but her exquisitely neat
blue gown and crisp white cap, cuffs and apron
were a delight. She had a fresh pink drawn
through her belt. Both plump hands were over
her eyes and she was crying to break her heart.
Her Little Charge sat solemnly by in a go-cart,
regarding her, and dangling a pet elephant by
one leg. The elephant, I may add, presented a
very singular appearance through having lost large
patches of its cloth and having been mended by grafting
on selections from the outside of some woolly sheep.</p>

<p>I was in doubt what to do; but when I am not sure
about offering my sympathy I always scan the victim
to see whether she shows any signs of “niceness.”
If she does I know that my sympathy will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
come amiss. The sight of that fresh pink determined
me: Little Nursemaid was “nice.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said I, “what is it?”</p>

<p>This sounds as if I have no dignity. I have, up
to the moment that some one cries, and then I
maintain that dignity loses its point. There is a
perfectly well-bred dignity which has hurt more
hearts than ever sympathy has bound up, but you
do not learn that until you are seventy and then
no one listens to what you have learned.</p>

<p>Little Nursemaid showed me one eye, blue as her
gown.</p>

<p>“Nothink, ma’am,” she said shamelessly, and fell
to sobbing anew.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said I gently, “you are not crying
for nothing, are you?”</p>

<p>Think of the times that all the women in the world
require to have that said to them.</p>

<p>Little Charge whimpered slightly as if to say that
he could cry all day if he chose, and only be scolded
for his pains. He was doubtless justly aggrieved
at my sympathy for a performance borrowed from
his own province. Little Nursemaid pushed the
go-cart with her foot, such a trim little well-shod
foot, <i>without</i> openwork stockings.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” I urged with even more persuasiveness.
“Perhaps I could help you, you know.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. No; nobody could help her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Is it that some one is dead?” I asked.</p>

<p>No; no one was dead.</p>

<p>“Well, then!” I exclaimed triumphantly, “that
is all I need to know. Tell me—and we can do
<i>something</i>, at any rate.”</p>

<p>Bit by bit she told me, pulling at her trim little
cuffs, twirling the head of the pink, rolling the go-cart
until Little Charge smiled as upon an unexpectedly
beneficent world.</p>

<p>And the trouble was—how, I wondered as I listened,
could I ever have doubted that the world is
the shape of a heart—the trouble was that Little
Nursemaid had intended to elope that very day, and
now she couldn’t!</p>

<p>Cornelia Emmeline Ayres, for so she subsequently
told me that she was called, was by her own admission
pathetically situated.</p>

<p>“I am a orphan nursemaid, ma’am,” she confessed,
shaking her brown head in pleasant self-pity.</p>

<p>Briefly, she was living with a well-to-do family
just off the avenue, who had cared for her mother in
her last illness and had taken charge of Cornelia
herself when she was a child. She had grown up in
the family as that most pitiful of all creatures, an
unpaid dependant, who is supposed to have all the
advantages of a home and in reality has only its discomforts.
Until a year ago the life of the little maid
had been colourless enough, and then the Luminous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
Inevitable happened. He was a young drug clerk.
He had had two “rises” of salary within seven months,
probably, I surmised, averaging some seventy-five
cents each. And she had fourteen dollars of her own.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said I in bewilderment, “what more
do you want? Why wait?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ma’am,” sobbed Cornelia Emmeline, “it’s
the unthankfulness I’m bothered about. Why, She
raised me an’ I just can’t a-bear to leave Her like
this.”</p>

<p>“What does She say about it?” I inquired, gathering
from the reverential tone of the pronoun that the
Shrewd Benefactress was in her mind. O, these
women whose charity takes the form of unpaid servants
who have “homes” in return.</p>

<p>“That’s just it, ma’am. She won’t hear to it,”
said Cornelia Emmeline sadly. “She says I’m too
young to have the care of a home.”</p>

<p>I looked at the stout proportions of Little Charge
who had to be carried and lifted all day.</p>

<p>“So you planned to elope?” I tempted her on.
“And why didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Then her heart overflowed.</p>

<p>“We was to go to the church to-night,” she sobbed.
“Evan, he told the m-m-minister, an’ I was goin’ to
wear my new p-p-plum-colour’ dress, an’ it was
a-goin’ to be at six-fifteen. Evan has a hour off at
six. An’ th-then th-this morning She gimme a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
bright fifty cents an’ a watered ribbin—an’ O,
ma’am, I just can’t a-bear to go an’ do it!”</p>

<p>So—Benefactress was even shrewder than I had
thought.</p>

<p>“Have you told him?” I asked, feeling with Evan
the hopelessness of competing with “a bright fifty
cents an’ a watered ribbin.”</p>

<p>She nodded speechlessly for a moment.</p>

<p>“Jus’ now,” she burst out finally. “I went to the
drug store an’ told him. He d-d-didn’t say a word,
but he jus’ went on makin’ a egg-phosphate, in a
heartbroke way, for a ole gentleman. He never
l-l-looked at me again.”</p>

<p>I sat in sad silence going over the principal points
of the narrative. Nothing makes me so sorrowful
as the very ordinary sight of two young lovers juggling
with their future. There are so few chances for
happiness in every life, “and that hardly,” and yet
upon these irreverent hands are constantly laid, and
all the hues despoiled. Thereafter the two despoilers
are wont to proclaim happiness a bubble. I do not
know if that be true, but say that it <i>is</i> a bubble. Is it
not better to have so luminous a thing ever trembling
over one’s head than to see, through one’s tears,
its fragments float away? If happiness be a bubble,
Pelleas and I know of one that has outlasted many a
stouter element and will last to the end. Yet what
can Seventy say of this to Seventeen? It can only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
wring its hands, and Seventeen has but one answer:
“But <i>this</i> is different!” I could have shaken Cornelia
Emmeline had it not been for our brief acquaintance.</p>

<p>As I sat considering this and pulling at the fringe
of my reticule, the last words that she had spoken
began to assert themselves with a vague, new significance.</p>

<p>“He d-d-didn’t say a word, but he jus’ went on
makin’ a egg-phosphate, in a heartbroke way,
for a ole gentleman,” she had said. My attention
had been so fixed on the image of Evan
behind the counter that a supreme coincidence had
escaped me.</p>

<p>I touched Cornelia Emmeline’s arm—I have
dignity, I repeat, but not in the face of such a
sorrow as this.</p>

<p>“What drug store?” I inquired.</p>

<p>There was only one in the world for her, so she
knew what I meant.</p>

<p>“How long ago were you there to tell him?” I
asked next, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Cornelia Emmeline thought that it might have
been a matter of twenty minutes.</p>

<p>“The very same!” I cried, and fell to smiling at
Little Nursemaid in a fashion that would have
bewildered her had she not been so occupied in
wiping her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>For who in the world should be the old gentleman
of the egg-phosphate but Pelleas?</p>

<p>Had I not, morning after morning, waited in that
very drug store, amusing myself before a glass case
of chest-protectors while Pelleas drank his egg-phosphate
which he loathed? And so that handsome,
curly-headed, long-lashed youngster who fizzed
and bubbled among his delicacies with such dexterity
was none other than Evan! Why, indeed, he was a
friend of Pelleas’. Pelleas had given him a red muffler
of his own only last Christmas.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you have what I call the
quality of making mental ends meet when you ought
to be concerned with soberer matters. For myself,
being a very idle and foolish and meddlesome old
woman, I can not only make them meet but I
can tie them into bowknots, veritable love knots.
And so I did now, sitting there on the bench
in the sunshine with the fragrance of Forsythia
and cherry blossoms about, and my eyes fixed on
the all-wool elephant of Little Charge. And yet,
remembering now, I disown that plan; for I protest
that it came pealing to me from some secret
bell in the air—and what could I, a most unwise
and helpless old woman, do against such magic?
And how else could one act—in a world the shape
of a heart?</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to tell me,” said I shyly, “how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
you had planned your elopement? It will do no
harm to talk about it, at any rate.”</p>

<p>Little Nursemaid liked to talk about it. With
many a sob and sigh she brought forth her poor little
plans, made with such trembling delight and all
come to naught. They were to have met that very
night at precisely quarter-past six at the door of a
chapel that I knew well. The curate had been engaged
by Evan, and a “little couple” who lived over
the drug store were to be witnesses. The new plum-colour’
dress figured extensively and repeatedly in
the account. Then they were to have marched
straight and boldly to the Benefactress and proclaimed
their secret, and Evan was to have been
back behind the counter at seven o’clock, while Cornelia
Emmeline would have been in time to put
Little Charge to bed, as usual. The remainder of
their lives, so far as I could determine, did not enter
importantly into the transaction. The main thing
was to be married.</p>

<p>And all this bright castle had toppled down before
the onslaught of “a bright fifty cents an’ a watered
ribbin.” Ah, Cornelia Emmeline! Yet she truly
loved him—mark you, if I had not believed in that
I would have left her to the solitary company of Little
Charge and the all-wool elephant. But since I did
believe in that I could not see those two dear little
people make a mess of everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“It is too bad,” said I innocently, “and let me
tell you what I suggest. You’ll be very lonely to-night
about six o’clock—and you will probably cry
and be asked questions. Don’t you want to run down
to my house for a few minutes to help me? I have
something most important to do.”</p>

<p>I had much trouble to keep from laughing at that
“something most important to do.”</p>

<p>Cornelia Emmeline promised readily and gratefully.
She had always that hour to herself, it appeared,
because then He came home—the husband
of Benefactress, I inferred—and wanted Little
Charge to himself before dinner. That was such a
pleasant circumstance that I began to feel kindly
toward even the Shrewd Benefactress and “Him.”
But I did not relent. I made Cornelia Emmeline
promise, and I saw that she had my card tucked away
for safe-keeping, and when we had talked awhile
longer about the danger of unthankfulness, and the
prospects of drug clerks, Little Charge suddenly
straightened out stiffly in the go-cart and demanded
his “bread’n’butter’n’sugar.” So she took him
away and nodded me a really bright farewell; and
when she had gone a few steps she came running
back and shyly laid something on my knee. It was
the fresh pink. After that you may be sure that I
would have carried on my plan in the face of all disaster,
save indeed the opposition of Pelleas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>But Pelleas is to be counted on in everything. He
has failed me but once, and that was in a matter of
a wedding which took place anyway and is therefore
an incident which hardly counts against him. I could
hardly wait for him to come home. I was at the
window when he reached the steps, and before he
could unbutton his greatcoat he knew the whole
story. But Pelleas is not inventive. He is sympathetic,
corroborative, even coöperative, but not inventive.
To him the situation simply closed down.</p>

<p>“Poor little souls,” he said ruefully, “now that is
hard. So that young rascal is in love. I didn’t
know he ever thought of anything but soda. It’s a
blessing he didn’t fix me up a chloroform phosphate
this morning in sheer misery. Too bad, too bad.
Won’t matters ever be straightened out, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“No later,” said I, “than seven o’clock to-night.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” cried Pelleas. “How?”</p>

<p>I told him, quivering with the pleasant occupation
of minding somebody else’s affairs. Pelleas listened
a little doubtfully at first—I have a suspicion that
all men strive to convince you of their superior judgment
by doubting, at first, every unusual project; all,
that is, save Pelleas, whose judgment <i>is</i> superior.
But presently as I talked a light began to break in
his face and then he wrinkled his eyes at the corners
and I knew that I had won the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Will you, Pelleas?” I cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I will,” Pelleas answered magnificently, “if I
have to take three egg-phosphates in succession to
win his confidence.”</p>

<p>Nichola knew very well that something unusual
and delightful was at harbour in the house that
afternoon. For Pelleas and I found it impossible
to read, and she kept coming in the room and
finding us with our heads together. Nichola is one
of those who suspect every undertone to mean a
gigantic enterprise. I think, moreover, that she
believes us wholly capable of turning the drawing-room
into a theater with boxes, and presenting a
comedy. Ah, well—that we may, as the days grow
colourless.</p>

<p>At a little before six o’clock Pelleas set out, I
figuratively dancing on the doorstep with excitement.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I whispered him in the hall, “don’t you
fail! Pelleas, if you fail, attractive as you are, I
shall be divorced from you!”</p>

<p>He smiled confidently.</p>

<p>“I feel as if we were eloping ourselves,” he said,
“and this is something like.”</p>

<p>Before the clock had gone six Nichola ushered into
the drawing-room Cornelia Emmeline Ayres. In
one glance I knew that I had not counted on her
in vain. To do honour to me she appeared in full
regalia of plum colour. But she had been crying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
all day—I saw that in the same glance, and her attempt
to be cheerful in her sadness and shyness
went to my heart.</p>

<p>We sat beside the fire where I could watch the
clock, but it seemed to me as if the very hands were
signaling to her what my plan was. Nichola came
in with more coals, which we needed considerably
less than more wall paper; but Nichola’s curiosity
is her one recreation and almost her one resource,
as I sometimes think. I trembled afresh
lest she knew all about this, as she did about
everything else, and would suddenly face about
on the hearth rug and recite the whole matter.
She went out in silence, however, and had heard
us discuss nothing but the best makes of go-carts,
which was the matter that first presented itself to
my mind.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear,” said I, when we were alone,
“haven’t you thought better of it? Shall we not be
married at fifteen past six, after all?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and the tears started as if by
appointment. No; we would not be married that
night, it would appear.</p>

<p>“Nor ever?” I put it point-blank. “Evan won’t
wait forever, you know.”</p>

<p>She looked forlornly in the fire.</p>

<p>“Not as long as She needs me around.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish!” cried I, at this. “There are a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
nursemaids as good as you, I dare say—but
there is only one wife for Evan.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he keeps a-sayin’,” she cried, and
broke down and sobbed.</p>

<p>The hands of the clock pointed rigidly at six.
Then and there I cast the die.</p>

<p>“I wish to go for a walk,” I said abruptly.
“Will you give me your arm for a block or so?”</p>

<p>My bonnet was ready on the hall-table and I had
kept the pink quite fresh to pin on my cloak. We
were off in no time and went down the avenue at
a brisk pace, while Nichola lurked about the area,
pretending to sweep and really devoured with curiosity.</p>

<p>Cornelia Emmeline looked up longingly at all the
big, beautiful homes, and down the cross-streets at
all that impertinent array of comfort, so hopelessly
professional, so out of sympathy with the amateur
in domesticity.</p>

<p>“So many homes all fixed up for somebody else,”
she said wistfully.</p>

<p>My heart ached as I thought of all the little people,
divinely in love, who have looked up at those grim
façades with the same thought. Personally, I prefer
a flat, but it takes one seventy years to learn even
this.</p>

<p>I talked on as well as I could about little in particular
and most of all I encouraged her to talk, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
I was becoming every moment more excited. For
every step was bringing us nearer and nearer to the
little chapel, and at last we rounded the corner and
were full upon it. A clock in a near-by steeple showed
six-fifteen. I looked anxiously up the street and the
street was empty.</p>

<p>“Let us,” said I, guilelessly, “go in here and rest
awhile.”</p>

<p>Little Nursemaid’s mouth trembled.</p>

<p>“Oh, ma’am—no, please—not in there! I
couldn’t go in there <i>to-night</i>,” she stammered.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said I sharply, pretending to be
very cross. “I am tired and I must have rest.”</p>

<p>She could do nothing but lead me up the steps,
but her poor little face was quite white. So was
mine, I suspect. Indeed, I fancy that neither of us
could have borne matters very much longer. Happily
there was no need; for when the double green doors
had closed behind us there in the dim anteroom
stood the faithful Pelleas and a bewildered Evan—who
very naturally failed to understand why a
strange old gentleman, whom he had hitherto connected
only with egg-phosphates and one red muffler,
should have decoyed him from his waiting supper
to a chapel of painful association.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I are not perfectly agreed on what did
happen next. For we had planned no farther than
the church door, trusting to everything to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
right the moment that those two little people saw
each other in the place of their dream. The first
thing that I recall is that I fairly pushed Cornelia
Emmeline into the arms of the young soda-fountain
king, and cried out almost savagely:—</p>

<p>“Be married—be married at once! And thank
the Lord that you love each other!”</p>

<p>“But She—what’ll She—” quavered Cornelia
Emmeline on a coat-lapel.</p>

<p>Then young Evan rose magnificently to the occasion.
He took her little white face in his hands,
kissed her very tenderly, and decided for her.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Sweetheart,” said he, “so we will!
And no more trouble about it!”</p>

<p>Little Nursemaid gave him one quick look—shy,
beseeching, delicious—and glanced down.</p>

<p>“I’ve got on my plum-colour’,” she consented.</p>

<p>Whereat Pelleas and I, who had been standing by,
smiling and nodding like mandarins, turned ecstatically
and shook hands with each other.</p>

<p>Evan, in the midst of all his bliss, looked at his
watch. It was plain to be seen that Cornelia Emmeline
had not put her trust in a worthless fellow.</p>

<p>“Six-twenty,” said he; “I’ll run across and get
the minister. O,” he turned to us helplessly,
“what if he can’t come—now?”</p>

<p>I shared his anxiety, being suspicious that in the
event of a postponement the store of “bright fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
cents and watered ribbins” might prove inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Then very leisurely the green baize doors swung
open and without undue haste or excitement in
walked the curate.</p>

<p>“Ah!” we four said breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Ah, my young friends,” said the curate, and
seemed to include us all—and at the time this did
not impress me as impossible—“I have been until
this moment detained at the bedside of a sick parishioner.
I regret that I am five minutes tardy.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir—why, sir—” stammered Evan, “we
meant—we didn’t mean—”</p>

<p>The curate looked his perplexity.</p>

<p>“Is this not the same?” he inquired, adjusting his
pince-nez and throwing his head back. “Did you
not make an appointment with me for six-fifteen
to-day? Surely I have not mistaken the day?”</p>

<p>At this young Evan burst into a laugh that sorely
tried the echoes of the anteroom.</p>

<p>“Bless me!” he cried, “if I ain’t forgot to tell
’im not to come!”</p>

<p>So there we were, snug as a planned-out wedding
with invitations and bells.</p>

<p>They were married in the vestry, and Pelleas and
I had the honour of writing our names below theirs,
and we both wiped our eyes right through the entire
process in a fashion perfectly absurd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Parents of the—?” hesitated the curate, regarding
us consultingly.</p>

<p>I looked at Pelleas in some embarrassment, and
I think we felt that he was concealing something
when he said simply: “No.” Perhaps it would not
have been legal or churchly had the curate known
that we had never seen Cornelia Emmeline until that
day and knew nothing of Evan save egg-phosphates.</p>

<p>On the steps of the chapel the two kissed each
other with beautiful simplicity, and young Evan
shook our hands with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>“How—how come you to do it?” he asked, this
phase of the hour having now first occurred to him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cornelia Emmeline, “I’ve been
a-wantin’ to ask.”</p>

<p>Pelleas and I looked at each other somewhat foolishly.</p>

<p>“Bless you!” we mumbled together. “I don’t
know!”</p>

<p>Off went young Evan like a god to his star, and
Cornelia Emmeline walked back with us, and we all
waved our hands at the far end of the street. Then
we left her at the door of the Shrewd Benefactress,
and with broken words the dear little soul in her
best plum-colour’ went blithely to Little Charge
and the all-wool elephant, and all the age was gold.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I walked soberly home.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said he darkly, “that they are minors?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“I really don’t care if they are,” cried I, with great
courage. “They have acted far less like minors
than we have.”</p>

<p>“Suppose—” he began again.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said, “how did you say that advertisement
was to be? ‘Pelleas and Etarre, Promoters
of Love Stories Unlimited—’”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, that’s all very well,” he insisted, “but
suppose—”</p>

<p>“And who was it,” I pursued, “who was half persuaded
that the world is the shape of a heart?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it was I,” Pelleas admitted then,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>But I could see that his eyes were without remorse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE DANCE</p>

<p>I think that by then Pelleas and I had fairly
caught the colour of Youth. For I protest that in
Spring Youth is a kind of Lydian stone, and the
quality of old age is proved by the colour which it
can show at the stone’s touch. Though perhaps with
us the gracious basanite has often exceeded its
pleasant office and demonstrated us to be quite mad.</p>

<p>Otherwise I cannot account for the intolerance of
age and the love of youth that came upon us. I was
conscious of this when after breakfast one morning
Pelleas and I stood at the drawing-room window
watching a shower. It was an unassuming storm of
little drops and infrequent gusts and looked hardly of
sufficient importance to keep a baby within-doors.
But we are obliged to forego our walk if so much as
a sprinkling-cart passes. This is so alien to youth
that it always leaves us disposed to take exception
and to fail to understand and to resort to all the
ill-bred devices of well-bred people who are too inventive
to be openly unreasonable.</p>

<p>As “What a bony horse,” observed Pelleas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Not really bony,” I said; “its ribs do not show in
the least.”</p>

<p>“It is bony,” reiterated Pelleas serenely. “It isn’t
well fed.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said I, “that is its type. A great
many people would say that a slender woman—”</p>

<p>“<i>They’re</i> bony too,” went on Pelleas decidedly. “I
never saw a slender woman who looked as if she had
enough to eat.”</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried, aghast at such apostasy; “think
of the women with lovely tapering waists—”</p>

<p>“Bean poles,” said Pelleas.</p>

<p>“And sloping shoulders—”</p>

<p>“Pagoda-shaped shoulders,” said Pelleas.</p>

<p>“And delicate pointed faces—”</p>

<p>“They look hungry, all the time, and bony,”
Pelleas dismissed the matter—Pelleas, who in
saner moments commiserates me upon my appalling
plumpness.</p>

<p>“There comes the butter woman,” I submitted,
to change the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Pelleas resentfully, finding fresh
fuel in this; “Nichola uses four times too much butter
in everything.”</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I rebuked him, “you know how careful
she is.”</p>

<p>“She is,” insisted Pelleas stubbornly, “extravagant
in butter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“She uses a great deal of oil,” I suggested tremulously,
not certain whether oil is the cheaper.</p>

<p>“Butter, butter, she spreads butter on the soup,”
stormed Pelleas. “I believe she uses butter to boil
water—”</p>

<p>Then I laughed. Pelleas is never more adorable
than when he is cross at some one else.</p>

<p>At that very moment the boy who was driving the
butter woman’s wagon began to whistle. It was a
thin, rich little tune, a tune that <i>pours</i> slowly, like
honey. I am not musical but I can always tell honey-tunes.
At sound of it Pelleas’ face lighted as if at a
prescription of magic.</p>

<p>“Etarre—Etarre!” he cried; “do you hear that
tune?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Do you remember—?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, just as breathlessly.</p>

<p>“It’s the Varsovienne,” cried Pelleas, “that we
danced together the night that I met you, Etarre.”</p>

<p>With that Pelleas caught me about the waist and
hummed the air with all his might and whirled me
down the long room.</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I struggled. “I don’t know it. Let
me go.”</p>

<p>For it has been forty years since I have danced or
thought of dancing and I could not in the least remember
the silly step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Leaving me to regain my breath as best I might
Pelleas was off up the room, around chairs and
about tables, stepping long and short, turning, retreating,
and singing louder and louder.</p>

<p>“You stood over there,” he cried, still dancing;
“the music had begun and I was not your partner—but
I caught you away before you could say no, and
we danced—<i>tol te tol te tol</i>—”</p>

<p>Pelleas was performing with his back to the hall
door when it opened softly, and he did not hear.
There stood Nichola. I have never before seen
that grim old woman look astonished, but at sight
of the flying figure of Pelleas she seemed ready
to run away. It was something to see old Nichola
taken aback. Our old servant is a brave woman,
afraid of nothing in the world but an artificial
bath heater which she would rather die than light,
but the spectacle of Pelleas, dancing, seemed
actually to frighten her. She stood silent for a full
minute—and this in itself was amazing in Nichola,
who if she went often to the theater would certainly
answer back to the player talk. Then Pelleas
faced the door and saw her. He stopped short as
if he had been a toy and some one had dropped the
string. He was frightfully abashed and was therefore
never more haughty.</p>

<p>“Nichola,” he said with lifted brows, “we did not
ring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Nichola remained motionless, her little bead eyes
which have not grown old with the rest of her
quite round in contemplation.</p>

<p>“We are busy, Nichola,” repeated Pelleas, slightly
raising his voice.</p>

<p>Then Nichola regained full consciousness and
rolled her eyes naturally.</p>

<p>“Yah!” said she, with a dignity too fine for scorn.
“<i>Busy!</i>”</p>

<p>Really, Nichola tyrannizes over us in a manner
not to be borne. Every day we tell each other this.</p>

<p>Pelleas looked at me rather foolishly when she had
disappeared.</p>

<p>“That was the way it went,” said he, ignoring the
interruption as one always does when one is nettled.
“<i>Tol te tol te tol</i>—”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you sing <i>da de da de da</i>, Pelleas?” I
inquired, having previously noticed that all the world
is divided into those who sing <i>tol</i>, or <i>da</i>, or <i>la</i>, or <i>na</i>.
“I always say ‘<i>da</i>.’”</p>

<p>“I prefer ‘<i>tol</i>,’” said Pelleas shortly.</p>

<p>Sometime I intend classifying people according
to that one peculiarity, to see what so pronounced a
characteristic can possibly augur.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” said I, to restore his good humour,
“what a beau you were at that ball, Pelleas.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he disclaimed, trying to conceal his
pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“And how few of us have kept together since,” I
went on; “there are Polly Cleatam and Sally Chartres
and Horace and Wilfred, all living near us; and
there’s Miss Lillieblade, too.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” Pelleas said, “and I suppose they
will all remember that very night—our night.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said I confidently.</p>

<p>Pelleas meditated, one hand over his mouth, his
elbow on his knee.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said; “I was thinking—I wouldn’t
be surprised if—well, why couldn’t we—”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at me in some suspicion that
I knew what he meant.</p>

<p>“Have them all here some evening?” I finished
daringly.</p>

<p>Pelleas nodded.</p>

<p>“And <i>dance</i>!” said he, in his most venturesome
mood.</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried, “and all wear our old-fashioned
things.”</p>

<p>Pelleas smiled at me speechlessly.</p>

<p>The plan grew large in our eyes before I remembered
the climax of the matter.</p>

<p>“Thursday,” I said below my breath, “Thursday,
Pelleas, is <i>Nichola’s day out</i>!”</p>

<p>“Nichola’s day out” sounds most absurd to every
one who has seen our old servant. When she came
to us, more than forty years ago, she had landed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
but two weeks before from Italy, and was a swarthy
little beauty in the twenties. She spoke small
English and was deliciously amazed at everything,
and her Italian friends used to come and take
her out once a week, on Thursday. With her
black eyes flashing she would tell me next day,
while she dressed me, of the amazing sights that
had been permitted her. Those were the days
when we had many servants and Nichola was my
own maid; then gradually all the rest left and
Nichola remained, even through one black year
when she had not a centime of wages. And so
she had grown gray and bent in our service and
had changed in appearance to another being and
had lost her graces and her disposition alike. One
thing only remained the same: She still had Thursday
evenings “out.”</p>

<p>Where in the world she found to go now, was a
favourite subject of speculation with Pelleas and me
over our drawing-room fire. She had no friends, no
one came to see her, she did not mention frequenting
any houses; she was openly averse to the dark—not
afraid, but averse; and her contempt for all
places of amusement was second only to her distrust
of the cable cars. Yet every Thursday evening
she set forth in her best purple bonnet and
black “circular,” and was gone until eleven o’clock.
Old, lonely, withered woman—where did she go?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Unless indeed, it was, as we half suspected, to take
certain lessons in magic whereby she seems to
divine our inmost thoughts and intentions.</p>

<p>And now for the first time we planned to make a
base and harmless advantage of Nichola’s absence.
We meant to give a party, a <i>dance</i>, with seven guests.
Nichola, we were certain, would not for a moment
have supported the idea; she would have had a
thousand silly objections concerning my sleeplessness
and our nerves and the digestion of Pelleas. We
argued that all three objections were inadequate,
and that Nichola was made for us and not we for
Nichola. This bold innovation of thought alone
will show how adventuresome we were become.</p>

<p>We set about our preparation with proper caution.
For one whole forenoon I kept Pelleas in the kitchen,
as sentinel to Nichola, driving her nearly mad with
his forced excuses for staying while I risked my neck
among boxes long undisturbed. But then I love an
attic. I have always a sly impulse to attempt
framing ours for a wall of our drawing-room. I
prefer most attics to some libraries. I have known
houses whose libraries do not invite, but gesticulate;
whose dining-rooms have an air of awful permanence,
like a ship’s dining-room; and whose drawing-rooms
are as uninhabitable as the guillotine; yet above
stairs would lie a splendid attic of the utmost distinction.
These places always have chests which thrill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
one with the certainty that they are filled with something—how
shall I say?—something which does
not anywhere exist: Vague, sumptuous things, such
as sultans give for wedding gifts, and such as parcels
are always suggesting without ever fulfilling the
suggestion. Yet when chests like these are opened
they are found to contain most commonplace
matter—trunk straps with the buckles missing,
printed reports of forgotten meetings called to exploit
forgotten enthusiasms, and cotton wadding.
Yet I never go up to our attic without an impulse
of expectancy. I dare say if I persist I shall
find a Spanish doubloon there some day. But that
morning I found only what I went to seek—the
lustrous white silk which I had worn on the night
that I met Pelleas. We had looked at it together
sometimes, but for very long it had lain unregarded
and the fine lace about the throat was yellowed
and it had caught the odour of the lonely days
and nights. But it was in my eyes no less beautiful
than on the night that I had first worn it.</p>

<p>I hid it away in my closet beneath sober raiment
and went down to release Pelleas. When I entered
the kitchen Nichola glanced at me once, and without
a word led me to the looking-glass in the door of the
clock.</p>

<p>“Yah?” she questioned suspiciously. “Is it that
you have been tomboning about, building fires?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>I looked, wondering vaguely what Nichola can
possibly mean by <i>tomboning</i>, which she is always
using. There was a great place of dust on my cheek.
I am a blundering criminal and should never be
allowed in these choice informalities.</p>

<p>That afternoon while Nichola was about her marketing,
Pelleas and I undertook to telephone to our
guests. When I telephone I always close my eyes,
for which Pelleas derides me as he passes; and
when he telephones he invariably turns on the light
on the landing. Perhaps this is because men are
at home in the presence of science while women,
never having been gods, fear its thunder-bolt
methods. Pelleas said something like this to our
friends:—</p>

<p>“Do you remember the ball at the Selby-Whitfords’?
Yes—the one on Washington’s Birthday
forty-nine years ago? Well, Etarre and I are going
to give another ball to the seven survivors. Yes—a
ball. Just we seven. And you must wear something
that you might have worn that night. It’s going to
be Thursday at eight o’clock, and it’s quite a secret.
Will you come?”</p>

<p>Would they come! Although the “seven survivors”
did suggest a steamship disaster, our guests
could have risen to no promise of festivity with
greater thanksgiving. At the light that broke over
Pelleas’ face at their answers my heart rejoiced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Would they come! Polly Cleatam promised for
herself and her husband, although all their grandchildren
were their guests that week. Sally Chartres’
son, a stout, middle-aged senator, was with
her but she said that she would leave him with
his nurse; and Miss Willie Lillieblade cried out
at first that she was a hermit with neuralgia and
at second thought added that she would come
anyway and if necessary be buried directly from
our house.</p>

<p>The hall was dark and silent again when Nichola
came toiling home and there was nothing to tell her,
as we thought, what plans had peopled the air in her
absence. Nor in the three days of our preparation
did we leave behind, we were sure, one scrap or
one breath of evidence against us. We worked with
the delighted caution of naughty children or escaping
convicts. Pelleas, who has a delicate taste in
sweets, ordered the cakes when he took his afternoon
walk and went back to the shop every day to charge
the man not to deliver the things until the evening.
My sewing woman’s son plays the violin “like his
own future,” as Pelleas applauds him, and it was
easy to engage him and his sister to accompany him.
Meanwhile I rearranged my old gown, longing for
Nichola, who has a genius in more than cookery.
To be sure Pelleas did his best to help me, though
he knows no more of such matters than the spirits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
of the air; he can button very well but to hook is
utterly beyond his simple art. However, he attended
to everything else. After dark on Thursday
he smuggled some roses into the house and though
I set the pitcher in my closet I could smell the flowers
distinctly while we were at dinner. It is frightful to
have a conscience that can produce not only terrors
but fragrances.</p>

<p>We were in a fever of excitement until Nichola got
off. While Pelleas tidied the drawing-room I went
down and wiped the dishes for her—in itself a matter
to excite suspicion—and I broke a cup and was
meek enough when Nichola scolded me. Every
moment I expected the ice cream to arrive, in which
event I believe I would have tried to prove to
Nichola that it was a prescription and that the cakes
were for the poor.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I waited fearfully over the drawing-room
fire, dreading her appearance at the door to
say her good-night; for to our minds every chair and
fixture was signaling a radiant “Party! Party!”
like a clarion. But she thrust in her old face, nodded,
and safely withdrew and we heard the street door
close. Thereupon we got upstairs at a perilous pace
and I had on the white gown in a twinkling while
Pelleas, his hands trembling, made ready too.</p>

<p>I hardly looked in the mirror for the roses had
yet to be arranged. I gathered them in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
arms and Pelleas followed me down, and as we
entered the drawing-room I felt his arm about
my waist.</p>

<p>“Etarre,” he said. “Look, Etarre.”</p>

<p>He led me to the great gilt-framed cheval glass set
in its shadowy corner. I looked, since he was
determined to have me.</p>

<p>I remembered her so well, that other I who forty-nine
years ago had stood before her mirror dressed
for the Selby-Whitford ball. The brown hair of
the girl whom I remembered was piled high on her
head and fastened with a red rose; the fine lace lay
about her throat and fell upon her arms, and the
folds of the silk touched and lifted over a petticoat of
lawn and lace. And here was the white gown and
here the petticoat and tucker, and my hair which is
quite white was piled high and held its one rose.
The white roses in my arms and in my hair were
like ghosts of the red ones that I had carried at that
other ball—but I was no ghost! For as I looked at
Pelleas and saw his dear face shining I knew that
I was rather the happy spirit risen from the days
when roses were not white, but merely red.</p>

<p>Pelleas stooped to kiss me, stooped just enough
to make me stand on tiptoe as he always does, and
then the door-bell rang.</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I scolded, “and the roses not arranged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“You know you wanted to,” said Pelleas, shamelessly.
And the truth of this did not in the least
prevent my contradicting it.</p>

<p>Sally Chartres and Wilfred came first, Sally talking
high and fast as of old. Such a dear little old
lady as Sally is. I can hardly write her down “old
lady” without a smile at the hyperbole, for though
she is more than seventy and is really Madame Sarah
Chartres, she knows and I know the jest and that
she is just Sally all the time.</p>

<p>She threw off her cloak in the middle of the floor,
her pearl earrings and necklace bobbing and ticking.
At sight of her blue gown, ruffled to the waist and
laced with black velvet, I threw my arms about her
and we almost laughed and cried together; for we
both remembered how, before she was sure that
Wilfred loved her, she had spent the night with me
after a ball and had sat by the window until dawn,
in that very blue frock, weeping in my arms because
Wilfred had danced so often with Polly Cleatam.
And now here was Wilfred looking as if he had had
no thought but Sally all his days.</p>

<p>In came Polly Cleatam herself presently in her
old silk poplin trimmed with fringe, and her dimples
were as deep as on the day of her elopement. Polly
was nineteen when she eloped on the evening of her
début party with Horace who was not among the
guests. And the sequel is of the sort that should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
suppressed, but I must tell it, being a very truthful
old woman and having once or twice assisted at an
elopement myself: <i>They are very happy.</i> Polly is an
adorable old lady; she has been a grandmother for
nineteen years, and the Offence is Lisa’s best friend.
But whereas Sally and I have no idea of our own age
Polly, since her elopement, has rebounded into a
Restraining Influence. That often happens. I
think that the severest-looking women I know have
eloped and have come to think twice of everything
else. Polly with an elopement behind her is invariably
the one to say “Hush,” and “I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Miss Willie Lillieblade was late. She came in
wound in costly furs—Heaven provided her bank
account in the neuter gender—and she stood revealed
in a gorgeous flowered gown, new, but quite
like the one which she had worn at the very ball that
we were celebrating. Miss Lillieblade is tiny, and
though her hair is quite white she seems to have taken
on none of the graces of age. She has grown old like
an expensive India-rubber ball, retaining some of
her elasticity and constantly suggesting her former
self instead of becoming another article altogether.
She has adopted caps, not soft, black, old-lady caps,
but perky little French affairs of white. She is erect—and
she walks with a tall white staff, silver-headed,
the head being filled with two kinds of pills though
few know about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>I fancy that we were in great contrast; for Miss
Lillieblade is become a fairy-godmother-looking old
lady; Polly Cleatam has taken on severity and poise
and has conquered all obstacles save her dimples;
Sally has developed into a <i>grande dame</i> of old lace
and Roman mosaic pins; and I look for all the world
like the plump grandmothers that they paint on
calendars.</p>

<p>Pelleas and Wilfred and Horace talked us over.</p>

<p>“Ah, well now,” said Wilfred, “they look not a
day older than when we were married, and Miss
Willie is younger than any one.”</p>

<p>Wilfred, who used to be slim and bored, is a plump,
rosy old gentleman interested in everything to the
point—never beyond—of curiosity. O these youthful
poses of languor and faint surprise, how they
exchange themselves in spite of themselves for the
sterling coin!</p>

<p>Horace beamed across at Polly—Horace is a man
of affairs in Nassau Street and his name is conjured
with as the line between his eyes would lead one to
suspect; yet his eyes twinkled quite as they used
before the line was there.</p>

<p>“Polly,” he begged, “may I call you ‘Polly’ to-night?
I’ve been restricted to ‘Penelope,’” he
explained, “ever since our Polly was born. Then
after her coming out she demanded the Penelope,
and I went back to the Polly I preferred. But now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
our Polly-Penelope is forty, and there is a little
seminary Polly who is Polly too, though I dare say
the mite may rebuke us any day for undue familiarity.
May I say ‘Polly’ now?”</p>

<p>Pelleas was smiling.</p>

<p>“I leave it to you,” he said generously to every one,
“to say if Etarre’s hair was not white at our wedding?
She has always looked precisely—but precisely!—the
way she looks now.”</p>

<p>Miss Willie Lillieblade sighed and tapped with her
staff.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said she. “Old married folk always live
in the past. I’m a young thing of seventy-four and
I’ve learned to live in the present. Let’s dance.
My neuralgia is coming back.”</p>

<p>We had the chairs away in a minute, and Pelleas
summoned from the dining-room the musicians—a
Danish lad with a mane of straight hair over his
eyes and his equally Danish sister in a collarless loose
wool frock. They struck into the Varsovienne with
a will and at the sound my heart bounded; and, Pelleas
having recalled to me the step when Nichola was
not looking, I danced away with Wilfred as if I
knew how to do nothing else. Pelleas danced with
Miss Willie who kept her staff in her hand and would
tap the floor at all the impertinent rests in the music,
while Pelleas sang “tol” above everything. Polly
insisted on dancing alone—I suspect because her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
little feet are almost as trim as when she wore one’s—and
she lifted her poplin and sailed about among
us. Sally kept her head prettily on one side for all the
world as she used, though now her gray curls were
bobbing. Horace, who suffers frightfully from gout,
kept beside her at a famous pace and his eyes were
quite triangular with pain. “<i>Tol te tol te tol!</i>” insisted
Pelleas, with Miss Willie holding her hand to
her neuralgia as she whirled. I looked down at the
figures on the carpet gliding beneath my feet and for
one charmed moment, with the lilt of the music in
my blood, I could have been certain that <i>now was not
now, but then</i>!</p>

<p>This lasted, as you may imagine, somewhat less
than three minutes. Breathless we sank down one by
one, though Sally and Pelleas, now together and now
alone, outdanced us all until we dreaded to think
what the morrow held for them both. Miss Lillieblade
was on her knees by the fire trying to warm
her painful cheek on an andiron knob and laughing
at every one. Polly with flushed face and tumbled
hair was crying out: “O, but stop, Sally!” and
“Pray be careful!” and fanning herself with an unframed
water-colour that had been knocked from
the mantel. We all knew for that matter that we
would have to pay, but then we paid anyway. If
one has to have gout and attendant evils one may
as well make them a fair exchange for innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
pleasure instead of permitting them to be mere usury.
Pelleas said that afterward.</p>

<p>Sally suddenly laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“They think that we have to be helped up and
down steps!” she said blithely.</p>

<p>We caught her meaning and joined in her laugh
at the expense of a world that fancies us to have had
our day.</p>

<p>“If we liked,” said Miss Lillieblade, “I have no
doubt we could meet here every night when no one
was looking, and be our exact selves of the Selby-Whitford
ball.”</p>

<p>Horace smiled across at Polly.</p>

<p>“Who would read <i>them</i> to sleep with fairy stories?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>Polly nodded her gray curls and smiled tenderly.</p>

<p>“And who would get my son, the senator, a drink
of water when he cried for it?” gayly propounded
Sally.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I were silent. The evenings that we
spent together in the nursery were bitterly long ago.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” said Miss Lillieblade with a little sigh,
“I could come, at any rate.”</p>

<p>For a moment she was silent. “Let’s dance
again!” she cried.</p>

<p>We danced a six-step—those little people could
play anything that we asked for—and then, to rest,
we walked through a minuet, Pelleas playing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
double rôle. And thereafter we all sat down and
shook our heads at the music and pretended to be
most exhausted, and I was glad that the rest pretended
for I really was weak with fatigue and so
was Pelleas. For half an hour we sat about the fire,
Miss Willie with her face constantly upon the andiron
though she recalled more delightful things
than anybody.</p>

<p>“Then there was Aunt Effié in Vermont,” she had
just said, her voice cracking deliciously on its high
tones, “who cooked marvelously. And when the
plain skirts came in she went about declaring that
she would never have one that wasn’t full, because
she couldn’t make a comforter out of it afterward!”</p>

<p>At that mention of marvelous cookery and in the
laugh which followed, Pelleas and I slipped without.
For we were suddenly in an agony of foreboding,
realizing horribly that we had not once heard the
area-bell ring. And if the ices and cakes had been
left outside it would probably be true that by now
they <i>had</i> gone to the poor.</p>

<p>The back stairway was dark for Nichola always
extinguishes all the lower lights when she goes out.
We groped our way down the stairs as best we might,
Pelleas clasping my hand. We were breathing
quickly, and as for me my knees were trembling.
For the first time the enormity of our situation overcame
me. What if the ices had not come? Or had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
been stolen? What about plates? And spoons?
Where did Nichola keep the best napkins? And
after all Sally was Madame Sarah Chartres, whose
entertainments were superb. All this flooded my
spirit at once and I clung to Pelleas for strength.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I murmured weakly, “did the ice-cream
man promise to have it here in time?”</p>

<p>“He’s had to promise me that every day since I
first ordered it,” Pelleas assured me cheerfully,
“five or six times, in all.”</p>

<p>“O,” said I, as if I had no character, “I feel as if
I should faint, Pelleas.”</p>

<p>Three steps from the bottom I stood still and
caught at his coat. Through the crack at the top of
the door I could see a light in the kitchen. At the
same moment an odour—faint, permeating, delicious,
unmistakable—saluted us both. It was coffee.</p>

<p>Pelleas flung open the door and we stood making a
guilty tableau on the lowest step.</p>

<p>The kitchen was brightly lighted and a fire blazed
on the hearth. The gas range was burning and a
kettle of coffee was playing its fragrant rôle. Plates,
napkins, and silver were on the dresser; the boxes
of ices were on the sill of the open area window; on
the table stood the cakes, cut, and flanked by a tray
of thin white sandwiches; the great salad bowl was
ready with a little tray of things for the dressing;
from a white napkin I saw protruding the leg of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
cold fowl; there was the chafing dish waiting to
hold something else delectable. And in the rocking-chair
before the fire, wearing an embroidered white
apron and waiting with closed eyes, sat Nichola.</p>

<p>“O Nichola,” we cried together in awed voices,
“Nichola.”</p>

<p>She opened an eye, without so much as lifting her
head.</p>

<p>“For the love of heaven,” she said, “it’s ’most time.
The coffee’s just ready an’ Our Lady knows you’ve
been havin’ a hard evenin’. Ain’t you hungry,
dancin’ so? Well, go back upstairs, the both of you.”</p>

<p>We went. In the dark of the stairway we clung
to each other, filled with amazement and thanksgiving.
We could hear Nichola moving briskly about
the kitchen collecting her delicacies. How <i>had</i> she
found us out? O, and now at last was not the secret
of her mysterious Thursday evenings revealed to us?
She did go somewhere for lessons in magic and she
had learned to read our inmost thoughts!</p>

<p>From above stairs came the laughter of the others,
echoes of that ancient ball which we had been pretending
to re-live, trading the empty past for the
largess and beauty of now.</p>

<p>Pelleas slipped his arm about me to help me up
the stairs.</p>

<p>“Etarre,” he said, “I am glad that now is now—and
not then!”</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE HONEYMOON</p>

<p>I have often deplored that unlucky adjustment
which allotted to the medicines, countries, flavouring
extracts, and the like, names which should have
been reserved for women. For example what
beautiful names for beautiful women are Arnica,
Ammonia, and Magnesia; as for Syria, one could
fall in love with a woman called Syria; and it
would be sufficient to make a poet out of any lover
to sit all day at the feet of a woman named Vanilla.</p>

<p>This occurred to me again as a fortnight later Pelleas
and I took our seats in the train for the sea, since
across the aisle sat a pale and pretty little invalid
girl whose companions called her “Phenie.” I do
not know what this term professed to abbreviate,
but I myself would have preferred to be known
by the name of some euphonious disease, say Pneumonia.
Monia would make a very pretty love-name,
as they say.</p>

<p>Our little neighbour should have had a beautiful
name. She looked not a day past ten, though I
learned that she was sixteen; and she was pale and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
spiritless, but her great dark eyes were filled with
the fervour which might have been hers if life had
been more kind. She had a merry laugh, and a
book; not what I am wont to call a tramp book,
seeking to interest people, but a book of dignity
and parts which solicits nobody, a book which
may have a bookplate under its leather wing.</p>

<p>I puzzled pleasantly over the two in whose charge
she appeared to be and finally I took Pelleas in my
confidence.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” said I, “do you think that those two
can be her parents?”</p>

<p>“Bless you, no, dear,” he answered; “they are not
old enough. She is more likely to be sister to one
of them. They are very much in love.”</p>

<p>“I noticed,” I agreed; “they must be old-young
married people.”</p>

<p>“Instead of young-old married people like us,”
Pelleas said.</p>

<p>For Pelleas and I, merely because we are seventy
and white-haired and frightened to cross streets, are
not near enough to death to treat each other so coldly
as do half the middle-aged. I cannot imagine a
breakfast at which we two would separate the morning
paper and intrude stocks and society upon our
companionship and our omelet. At hotels I have
seen elderly people who looked as if breakfast could
a prison make and coffee cups a cage. Pelleas and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
I are not of these, and we look with kindly eyes upon
all who have never known that youth has gone,
because love stays.</p>

<p>So we were delighted when we saw our old-young
married people and the little invalid preparing to
leave the train with us. When we drew into our
station the big kindly conductor, with a nasturtium
in a buttonhole, came bearing down upon Little
Invalid and carried her from the car in his vast arms
and across the platform to a carriage. And we, in a
second carriage, found ourselves behind the little
party driving to the sea.</p>

<p>I had been so absorbed in our neighbours that
until the salt air blew across our faces I had forgotten
what a wonderful day it really was to be.
Pelleas and I were come alone to the seaside with no
one to look after us and no one to meet us and we
meant to have such a holiday as never had been
known. It came about in this wise:—</p>

<p>We were grown hungry for the sea. All winter
long over our drawing-room fire we had talked about
the sea. We had pretended that the roar of the
elevated trains was the charge and retreat of the
breakers and we had remembered a certain summer
years before, when—Pelleas still being able to
model and I to write so that a few were deceived—we
had taken a cottage having a great view and no
room, and we had spent one of the summers which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
are torches to the years to follow. Who has once
lived by the sea becomes its fellow and it is likely to
grow lyric in his heart years afterward and draw him
back. So it had long been drawing Pelleas and me
until, the Spring being well advanced, we had risen
one morning saying, “We must go to-morrow.”</p>

<p>We had dreaded confessing to Nichola our intention.
Nichola renounces everything until her renunciations
are not virtue but a disease. She cannot
help it. She is caught in a very contagion of renunciation,
and one never proposes anything that she does
not either object to or seek to postpone. When the
day comes for Nichola to die it has long been my
belief that she will give up the project as a self-indulgence.
Therefore it was difficult for us to approach
her who rules us with the same rod which she
continually brandishes over her own spirit. It was
I who told her at last; for since that day when
Nichola came upon Pelleas trying to dance, he has
lost his assurance in her presence, dislikes to address
her without provocation, and agrees with everything
that she says as if he had no spirit. I, being a very
foolhardy and tactless old woman, put it to her in
this way:—</p>

<p>“Nichola! Pelleas and I are going to the seashore
for all day to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yah!” said Nichola derisively, putting her gray
moss hair from her eyes. “Boat-ridin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“No,” said I gently, “no, Nichola. But we
want the sea—we need the sea.”</p>

<p>Nichola narrowed her eyes and nodded as if she
knew more about the sea than she would care to tell.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” she said with resignation, “I s’pose
the good Lord don’t count suicide a first-class crime
when you’re old.”</p>

<p>“We shall want breakfast,” I continued with great
firmness, “at half after six.”</p>

<p>“The last breakfast that I’ll ever have to get you,”
meditated Nichola, turning her back on me. The
impudent old woman believes because she is four
years younger than I that she is able to look after me.
I cannot understand such self-sufficiency. I am
wholly able to look after myself.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I dreamed all that night of what the
morrow held for us. We determined to take a little
luncheon and, going straight to the beach and as
near to the water as possible, lie there in the sand the
whole day long.</p>

<p>“And build sand houses and caves with passages
<i>sidewise</i>,” said Pelleas with determination and as if
he were seven.</p>

<p>“And watch the clouds and the gulls,” said I.</p>

<p>“And find a big wave away out and follow it till
it comes in,” Pelleas added.</p>

<p>“And let the sand run through our fingers—O,
Pelleas,” I cried, “I think it will make us young.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>So the sea spoke to us and we were wild for that
first cool salt breath of it, and the glare and the gray
and the boom of the surf. But Nichola, to whom
the sea is the sea, bade us good-bye next morning with
no sign of relenting in her judgment on us.</p>

<p>“Well packed with flannel?” she wanted to know.
And we went out in the street feeling like disobedient
children, undeserving of the small, suggestive parcel
of lunch which at the last moment she thrust in our
hands.</p>

<p>“After all,” Pelleas said, “what is it to Nichola
if we get drowned or run over?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” we agreed with ungrateful determination.</p>

<p>Yet when we reached our station we had become
so absorbed in Little Invalid that the sea had almost
to pluck us by the sleeve before we remembered.</p>

<p>It was early for guests at the hotel and but few were
on the veranda. Little Invalid was lifted from her
carriage and placed in a rocking-chair while the
old-young married people went in the office. And
when Pelleas suggested that I rest before we go down
to the beach I gladly assented and sat with him beside
the little creature, who welcomed me with a shy smile.
She was so like a bird that I had almost expected her
to vanish at my approach; and when she did not
do so the temptation to talk with her was like the
desire to feed a bird with crumbs from my hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“It is pleasant to be near the sea again,” I said to
her, by way of crumbs.</p>

<p>Her eyes had been fixed on the far blue and they
widened as she turned to me.</p>

<p>“‘Again’?” she repeated. “I haven’t ever seen it
before, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“You have not?” I said. “What a sorrow to live
far from the sea.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I live in New York—we all
three have lived in New York always—but I never
saw anything of the sea, only from the Battery.
None of us has but Henny. Henny has been to
Staten Island.”</p>

<p>I was silent in sheer bewilderment. Then it was
true; there are people living in New York who have
never seen the sea.</p>

<p>Something else trembled on Little Invalid’s lips
and out it came, hesitating.</p>

<p>“Bessie an’ Henny’s married last week,” she imparted
shyly, touching a great coloured button picture
of Bessie upon her waist. “This is their honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“O,” I observed, brightening, “then you will be
here for some time. I am so glad.”</p>

<p>Again she shook her head.</p>

<p>“O, no, ma’am,” she answered, “we’re going
back to-night. This is Henny’s day off, but Bessie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
she wouldn’t come without me. She’s my sister,” said
Little Invalid proudly; “she paid my way herself.”</p>

<p>Was it not wonderful for an old woman whose
interests are supposed to be confined to draughts and
diets to be admitted to such a situation as this? I
was still speechless with the delight of it when the
old-young married people came outside.</p>

<p>Bessie, the sister to Little Invalid and the bride of a
week, was a gentle, worn little woman in the thirties,
of shabby neatness, and nervous hands wide and
pink at the knuckles, and a smile that was like the
gravity of another. “Henny”—I perceive that
my analogy extends farther and that some men would
better have been christened Nicotine or Camphor—Henny
was a bit younger than she, I fancied, and the
honest fellow’s heavy, patched-looking hands and
quick, blue eyes would immediately have won my
heart even if I had not seen the clumsy care that he
bestowed upon Little Invalid, as though a bear
should don a nurse’s stripes.</p>

<p>Pelleas says that I spoke to them first. I dare say
I did, being a very meddlesome old woman, but the
first thing that I distinctly recall was hearing Henny
say:—</p>

<p>“Now, you run along down the beach, Bess, an’
I’ll sit here a spell with Phenie!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’d be all right all alone,” protested
Little Invalid feebly, looking nervously about at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
fast-gathering groups of chattering people. However
Bessie and Henny seemed to know very much
better than this, and with her smile that was like
gravity Bessie moved reluctantly away.</p>

<p>Fancy that situation. Little Invalid could not
be carried to the sands, and those two old-young
married people meant to spend their “honeymoon”
in taking turns at visiting the beach. I looked at
Pelleas and his face made the expression which
means an alarm, for something to be done at once.</p>

<p>“Why,” I asked casually, “don’t you both go down
to the beach and let us sit here awhile?” For to tell
the truth the journey by the train had tired me
more than I cared to confess.</p>

<p>I remember how Pelleas once sent two incredibly
dirty little boys into the circus at the Garden, and
save then I really think that I never saw such sudden
happiness in the face of any one.</p>

<p>“Were—were you goin’ to sit here anyway,
ma’am?” Bessie asked, trying as heroically to conceal
her joy as if it had been tears.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I assured her shamelessly, and really I
was over-tired. “Stay as long as ever you like,” I
said.</p>

<p>“O, ma’am,” said Henny with shining eyes,
“thank you! And thank you, sir!”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Pelleas gruffly and thrust my sunshade
in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>Off they went down the beach, Shabby Neatness
hanging on her husband’s arm in a fashion which I
cannot call deplorable, and her husband looking
down at her adoringly. Before they disappeared past
the pavilion we all waved our hands. And then to
my amazement I saw tears on the face of Little
Invalid.</p>

<p>“O, ma’am,” she said, her lips trembling, “you
don’t know what this will mean to them—you don’t
know!”</p>

<p>“Let me see your book, my dear,” I said hastily,
ashamed enough to be praised for indulging my own
desire to rest.</p>

<p>She handed the distinguished-looking little volume
and I saw that it was a very bouquet of sea poems,
sea songs, sea delight in every form. Beloved names
nodded to me from the page and beloved lines smiled
up at me.</p>

<p>“The settlement lady lief me take it,” said Little
Invalid.</p>

<p>Then began an hour whose joy Pelleas and I love
to remember. It would have been pleasure merely
to sit in that veranda corner within sound of the
sea and to hear Pelleas read those magic words; but
we had a new and unexpected joy in the response of
this untutored little maid who was as eager as were
we. With her eyes now on the sea, now on the face
of Pelleas as he read, now turned to me with the swift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
surprise of something that his voice held for her, she
sat breathlessly between us; and sometimes when a
passage had to be explained her eyes were like the
sea itself with the sun penetrating to its unsounded
heart.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she would say, “was it all there all the time—was
it? I read it alone but I didn’t know it was
like this!”</p>

<p>It puzzled her to find that what we were reading
had been known and loved by us for very long.</p>

<p>“Did the settlement lady lief you have the book,
too?” she asked finally.</p>

<p>“No,” we told her, “we have these things in other
books, ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought,” she said then in bewilderment,
“that there was only one book of every kind. And
I thought how grand for me to have this one, and
that I’d ought to lend it to people who wouldn’t
ever see it if I didn’t. Is there other ones like it?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Gradually the shy heart opened to us and we spoke
together of the simple mysteries of earth. For
example Little Invalid knew nothing of the tides
and the moon’s influence, and no triumph of modern
science could more have amazed her. Then from
the terrifying parlour of the hotel we brought to her
pieces of coral and seaweed, and these she had
never seen and she touched them with reverent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
fingers. In the parlour too was an hourglass filled
with shining sand—it was like finding jewels in the
coal bin to extract things of such significance from
that temple of plush and paper flowers. She held
the coral and the seaweed and the hourglass while
we went back to the little book or sat watching the
waves, gray-green, like the leaves of my moth geranium.</p>

<p>In this manner two hours had passed without our
suspecting when, flushed and breathless, Bessie and
Henny reappeared. They were very distressed
and frightened over having stayed so long away,
but no degree of embarrassment could disguise
their happy possession of those two hours on the
white beach.</p>

<p>Pelleas beamed on them both.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, now,” he said, “we couldn’t think of
going away down there before luncheon. Run
along back, but mind that you are here by one
o’clock. You are to lunch with us.”</p>

<p>At that my heart bounded, though I knew very well
that Pelleas had intended certain five dollars in his
portemonnaie for far other and sterner purposes.
Yet it is a great truth that the other and sterner purposes
are always adjusted in the end and the commonwealth
goes safely on no matter how often you divert
solitary bills to radiant uses with which they have no
right to be concerned. Being I dare say a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
spendthrift old woman I cannot argue matters of
finance, but this one principle I have often noted; and
I venture to believe that the people who omit the
radiant uses are not after all the best citizens. I
write this in defence of Pelleas, whose financial
conscience troubled him for many a day on account
of that luncheon.</p>

<p>So back those old-young married people went to
the beach, trying hard, as I could see, not to appear
too delighted lest Little Invalid feel herself a burden
to us all. And when they returned at one o’clock
with bright eyes and cheeks already beginning to
tan, Pelleas marshaled us all to a table by a window
toward the sea, and a porter drew Little Invalid’s
chair beside us.</p>

<p>What a luncheon was that. Time was—when
Pelleas was still able to model and I to write so as to
deceive a few—that we have sat at beautiful dinner
tables with those whose jests we knew that we should
read later, if we outlived them, set in the bezel of a
chapter of their biographies—and such a dinner is
likely to give one a delicious historic feeling while one
is yet pleasantly the contemporary of the entrée.
Time has been too when a few of us have sat about a
simple board thankful for the miracle of that companionship.
But save the dinners which Pelleas
and I have celebrated alone I think that there never
was another such dinner in our history. When his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
first embarrassment was gone we found that Henny
had a quiet drollery which delighted us and caused
his wife’s eyes to light adoringly. They said little
about themselves; indeed, save for the confidences of
Little Invalid, we knew when we parted nothing
whatever about them, and yet we were the warmest
friends. However, it was enough to have been let
into that honeymoon secret.</p>

<p>And what a morning had those two had. I cannot
begin to recount what experiences had been
theirs with great waves that had overtaken them,
with dogs that had gone in after shingles, and
with smooth stones and “angel-wing” shells and
hot peanuts of which they had brought a share to
Little Invalid. I cannot recall what strange people
they had met and remembered. Above all I cannot
tell you how they had listened to that solemn
beat and roar, and would try to make us know
its message—of course they did not know that
this was what they tried to tell us, but Pelleas
and I understood well enough.</p>

<p>After luncheon when Little Invalid was back on
the veranda, her cheeks flushed with the unwonted
excitement—it was her first dinner in a real hotel,
she told me—Pelleas leaned against a pillar with an
exaggerated air which I could not fathom, until:—</p>

<p>“Really,” he said, “I’m so very sleepy that I’m
going to settle myself in this big chair for a doze.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
Don’t you want to rest for a little, Etarre? Suppose
that we three all have a long quiet nap and you
two young people get back to the beach for a while
so as not to bother us.”</p>

<p>Bless Pelleas. And I confess that I was not unwilling
to rest. So the two went away again, and I
believe that Pelleas did sleep; but Little Invalid
and I, though we pretended to be asleep, sat with our
heads turned away from each other, staring out to
sea. I do not know how it may have been with her,
but as for me I was happy out of all proportion to
the encouragement of that noisy veranda. Perhaps
it was the look of the sea line, pricked with sails, or
the mere rough, indifferent touch of the salt wind.</p>

<p>Presently we all pretended to wake and talk a little;
and then we saw Bessie and Henny coming back and
at a sign from Pelleas we all shut our eyes again,
though Pelleas appeared to awake very crossly and
bade them go back and not disturb us unless they
wanted to be great nuisances. So they ran back, and
we laughed at them in secret, and Little Invalid sat
happily holding the mysterious hourglass. And
then a band began to play in the pavilion—a dreadful
band I thought until I saw the ecstatic delight of
Little Invalid, whereupon I discovered that there
was a lilt in its clamour.</p>

<p>When the bathers went in we found a glass for
her, and she spent a pleasant half hour watching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
ropes. And twice more Bessie and Henny came back
and both times we pretended to be asleep, and Pelleas
awoke more testily each time and scolded them back.
The second time he thrust something in their hands.</p>

<p>“Just pitch this in the ocean,” he said crossly,
“or eat it up. It worries me.”</p>

<p>Secretly I looked from one eye and saw Nichola’s
lunch disappearing.</p>

<p>When they came back at six o’clock we consented
to be awake, for it was time for Pelleas and me to
go home. They stood before us trying with pleasant
awkwardness to make us know various things, and
Little Invalid kept tightly hold of my fingers. When
I bent to kiss her good-bye she pressed something in
my hand, and it was the great coloured button-picture
of Bessie.</p>

<p>“Keep it,” she said, “to remember us by. There
ain’t nothink else fit to give you!”</p>

<p>Henny handed me to the carriage in an anguish of
polite anxiety, and they all three waved their hands
so long as we could see them. They were to stay
two hours longer and finish that honeymoon.</p>

<p>As Pelleas and I drove up the long street, our
backs to the sea, we turned for one look at the moving
gold of it under the falling sun. We felt its breath
in our faces for the last time—well, who knows?
When one is seventy every time may be the last time,
though indeed I should not have been surprised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
find us both sea-bathing before the Summer was
over.</p>

<p>Pelleas looked at me with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“Etarre,” he said, “I am afraid that we have indulged
ourselves shamefully to-day.”</p>

<p>“You mean about the luncheon party?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, that,” he said, “and then we came down
here for the sea to do us good and we haven’t been
near the sea.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “we haven’t.”</p>

<p>“We have simply amused ourselves all day long,”
he finished disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “we have.”</p>

<p>But as the train drew over the salt marshes I
smiled at this disgust of Pelleas’, smiled until my
hand crept down and found his under his hat.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, seeing my smile.</p>

<p>“I’ve found out something,” I told him.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t their honeymoon so much,” I said triumphantly,
“as it was ours.”</p>

<p>As we came through the long cross street toward
our house we had a glimpse of Nichola beside our
area gate, watching for us. But when we reached
the gate she was not in sight and though we waited
for a moment on our steps she did not come to open
the door. It was not until Pelleas had lighted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
fire in the drawing-room and we sat before it that we
heard her coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>She brought us tea, neither volunteering a word of
greeting nor, save by a word and with averted eyes,
responding to ours. But as she was leaving the room
she stood for a moment in the doorway.</p>

<p>“How’d your lunch go?” she demanded.</p>

<p>Instantly Pelleas and I looked at each other—we
never can remember not to do that. What <i>had</i>
Nichola given us in that lunch?</p>

<p>“Why, Nichola,” said I, “Nichola, your lunches
are always—that is, I never knew your lunches
not to be—”</p>

<p>“You are a wonderful cook, you know, Nichola,”
said Pelleas earnestly.</p>

<p>Nichola looked down upon us, her little eyes winking
fast, and she nodded her old gray head.</p>

<p>“Yah!” she said, “what I put in it was fruit an’
crackers. An’ I see you’ve give it away.”</p>

<p>“O, Nichola—” we began. But as captain of
the moment she would not sally forth to parley.</p>

<p>“There’s your tea,” she cut us short; “drink it—if
you ain’t drownded an’ your shades settin’ here
instead.”</p>

<p>Pelleas looked up bravely.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure about myself, Nichola,” he said
gently; “one never is sure about one’s self, you know.
But this lady is real, I do assure you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“And this, Nichola,” said I, gayly, “I protest is a
real gentleman!”</p>

<p>On which we two laughed in each other’s eyes;
and Nichola, that grim old woman, said sharply:—</p>

<p>“Our Lady knows you talk enough nonsense to
be new-married, the both.”</p>

<p>She clicked the portière rings, like little teeth.
And at her words Pelleas and I looked at each other
in abashment. Does all the world, like Nichola,
guess at our long honeymoon?</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE OTHER TWO</p>

<p>Pelleas has a little niece who when she sits in my
room in the sun combing her brown hair looks like a
mermaid. I told her this when on the morning after
our return from the seashore she arrived to make
us a visit and came to sit in my sunny window with
her hair all about her shoulders drying from its
fragrant bath.</p>

<p>“Lisa,” I said, for the sea was still in my soul,
“if I might tie your hair back with a rainbow and
set you on a tall green and white wave you would be
a mermaid. And by the way,” I added, “perhaps
you can tell me something about which I have always
wondered: How the mermaids in the sea pictures
keep their hair so dry?”</p>

<p>For answer Lisa smiled absently and spread a soft
strand into shining meshes and regarded it meditatively
and sighed dolorously. But Lisa was twenty,
and Twenty is both meditative and dolorous, so I
went on tranquilly laying sachets in my old lace; for
at seventy I have sunk some of my meditation and
all my dolour in such little joys as arranging my one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
box of rare old lace. That seems a small lesson for
life to have taught, and yet it was hard to learn.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I was murmuring, when Lisa said:—</p>

<p>“Aunt Etarre, were you ever in love?”</p>

<p>Is it not notable what fragrance floats in the room
when that question is asked? Of course it may
have been the orris in my hands, but I think that it
was more than this.</p>

<p>“If forty-nine and three quarters years of being in
love,” I reminded her, “would seem to you fair
proof that I—”</p>

<p>“O, that kind,” Lisa said vaguely. “But I mean,”
she presently went on, “were you ever in love so
that you were miserable about everything else, and
you thought all the time that somebody couldn’t
possibly love you; and so that seeing the postman
made your heart beat the way it used to at school
exhibition, and so that you kept the paper that came
around flowers....”</p>

<p>Lisa saw me smiling—not at her, Heaven forbid—but
at the great collection of rubbish in the
world saved because somebody beloved has touched
it, or has seen it, or has been with one when one was
wearing it.</p>

<p>“I mean were you ever in love like that, Aunt
Etarre—were you?” Lisa put it wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, well now, yes indeed,” I answered; “do you
think that my hair was always straight on rainy days,
as it is now?”</p>

<p>Lisa sighed again, even more dolorously, and
shook her head.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been the same,” she murmured
decidedly.</p>

<p>Poor, dear Twenty, who never will believe that Seventy
could have been “the same.” But I forgot
to sigh for this, so concerned I was at this breaking
of Lisa’s reticence, that enviable flowery armour of
young womanhood. So I waited, folding and refolding
my Mechlin, until I had won her confidence.</p>

<p>He was, it developed, a blessed young lawyer, with
very long lashes and a high sense of honour inextricably
confused with lofty ideals and ambitions
and a most beautiful manner. He was, in fact,
young Eric Chartres, grandnephew to my dear
Madame Sally Chartres. The sole cloud was the
objection of Dudley Manners, Lisa’s guardian, to
the friendship of the two on the hackneyed ground
of their youth; for Eric, I absently reckoned it
aloud, was one year and five months older than Lisa.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t as if he hadn’t seen the world,”
Lisa said magnificently. “He has been graduated
from college a year, and he has been abroad twice—once
when he was nine, and then for two months
last Summer. And he has read everything—O<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Aunt Etarre,” said Lisa, “and then think of his
loving me.”</p>

<p>“When am I going to meet him?” I asked, having
exchanged with him only a word in a crowded room
or two. As I expected Lisa flung herself down at
my knee and laid her hands over the old Mechlin.</p>

<p>“O would you—would you? Uncle Dudley
said he would trust me wholly to you and Uncle
Pelleas. Might he call—might he come this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“The telephone,” said I, “is on the landing.”</p>

<p>Below stairs I told Pelleas about it and he sighed
and looked in the fire and said, “Bless me, I used to
wheel her mother about in a go-cart!”</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” said I, thoughtfully, “I have seen
that young Eric Chartres only once or twice in a
crowded room, but do you know that I thought he
looks a little—just a very little—as you looked
at his age?”</p>

<p>“Does he really?” Pelleas asked, vastly pleased,
and “Pooh!” he instantly added to prove how little
vanity he has.</p>

<p>“He does,” I insisted; “the first time I caught
sight of him I could have believed—”</p>

<p>Pelleas turned to me with a look almost startled.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he confessed, “more than once
when I have looked at Lisa—especially Lisa in
that gown with flowers in and the <i>spingley</i> things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
that shine,” described Pelleas laboriously,—“I could
almost have thought that it was you as you used to
be, Etarre. Yes—really. There is something
about the way that she turns her head—”</p>

<p>“And so Eric Chartres may call?” said I eagerly,
with nothing but certainty.</p>

<p>“Of course he may call,” Pelleas said heartily;
“any fine fellow who is honestly in love is as welcome
here as a king.”</p>

<p>“Then,” I continued, making a base advantage
of his enthusiasm, “let us go down together and tell
Nichola to have tea, served in her best fashion, at
five this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Pelleas looked doubtful. “She’s making raised
doughnuts,” he demurred.</p>

<p>“But,” I reasoned, “her tea rose bloomed yesterday.
She is bound to believe in a beautiful thing or
two. Let us risk it.”</p>

<p>Nichola was picking her doughnuts from the hot
lard as delicately as if she had been selecting violets
for essences near her native Capri. She did not deign
to turn or to speak as we slipped in at the door.
Even when Pelleas had put the case to her, diplomatically
dwelling on the lightness of the delicacies
desired, she did not reply until she had brought to
the table a colander of her hot brown dainties.
Then she rested her hands on each side of the pan
and leaned forward. As I looked at her, her gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
hair brushed smoothly back from her rugged face,
her little eyes quick-winking—as if the air were
filled with dust—I caught on her face an expression
which I have seldom seen there: a look as if her
features were momentarily out of drawing; as if,
say, old Nichola’s face were printed on cloth and
the cloth had been twitched a bit awry.</p>

<p>“Who’s a-comin’?” she demanded; but if Nichola
were to ask to see our visiting list I think that we
should hardly deny her.</p>

<p>“It’s a friend of Miss Lisa’s,” Pelleas explained.</p>

<p>“Man?” Nichola inquired grimly.</p>

<p>Pelleas admitted it. I, now fancying myself wiser
in the conceits of Nichola, ventured something else.</p>

<p>“I think, Nichola,” I said, “that they—that he—that
they—and I thought if you had some
absolutely simple sandwiches—”</p>

<p>“Yah!” Nichola exclaimed. “So there’s to be
two pair o’ you!”</p>

<p>Then something wonderful happened. Nichola
slipped both hands beneath her floury apron and
rolled up her arms in its calico length and put her
head on one side and smiled—such a strange,
crinkled smile interfering with all her worn features
at once.</p>

<p>“My father had many goats,” Nichola said without
warning, “and one Summer I went with him to
buy more, though that was before my bones were all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
turned to cracked iron, you may be sure. And there
was a young shepherd—”</p>

<p>At that magic moment a sharp snapping and
crackling came from the kettle, and Nichola wheeled
with a frown.</p>

<p>“So!” she cried angrily, “you come down here,
letting my lard get too hot to go near to! Is it not
that I am baking? And as for tea, it may be that
there isn’t any tea. Go away!”</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” said I, as we climbed the stairs, “if it
were not that Nichola is too old to work anywhere
else—”</p>

<p>“I know it,” Pelleas nodded frowning.</p>

<p>This is the dialogue in which we take part after
each of Nichola’s daily impertinences.</p>

<p>At four o’clock that afternoon I was roused from
my drowsihead on hearing a little tap at my door.
Lisa came in, her face flushed, her blue embroidered
frock shimmering and ruffling to her feet.</p>

<p>“O Aunt Etarre,” she begged, “put on your
gray gown and your Mechlin fichu, will you? And
come down right away—well, almost right away,”
she added naïvely.</p>

<p>“I will come presently,” I assured her, as if I did
not understand; and then the bell rang and Lisa, her
eyes like stars, tapped down the stairs.</p>

<p>I was a long time about my dressing. The gray
grosgrain silk is for very special occasions, and I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
not worn my Mechlin collar since Pelleas’ birthday
nearly a year ago. When I had them both on
and my silver comb in my hair I heard Nichola’s
step outside my door. I bade her enter, but she
merely stood for a moment on the threshold.</p>

<p>“Che!” she said grimly. “I hope, mem, you’ve
got your neck well packed with flannel under that
slimpsey stuff. One would say you dress lightly,
lightly for fear of missing the rheumatism.”</p>

<p>She had gone crookedly down the passage before
I had opportunity to remention the tea. In a
moment she came back, threw open my door and
flung something on the bed.</p>

<p>“There,” she said crossly, “put it on! No need
to dress as if you was ninety.”</p>

<p>And there on my pillow I saw as she hastened away
the great pink tea rose that had blossomed only
that day from the rose plant in her own window
where she had tended it for months.</p>

<p>Pelleas was in the library across the hall from the
drawing-room where those two dear little people were.
I opened the library door softly and went in and
stood close beside his chair before he turned. Pelleas
is not in the least deaf, as we both know; he is simply
no longer distracted by small, unnecessary noises.</p>

<p>He looked up smiling and then sprang to his feet
and suddenly caught my hands and held me at arm’s
length and bade me turn about slowly, slowly so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
he might see. One would think that I had never
worn my old grosgrain and my Mechlin. I told him
so, though I can never conceal delight. And we
talked a little about the first night that I had worn it—O,
so many years before, and about many things
in which the very sunshine of the room had no part
because these things were so much more luminous.</p>

<p>At last when the clock struck five we crossed the
hall to the drawing-room door. At the foot of the
stairs Pelleas stopped for a moment.</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Etarre,” he said, “the night
that I ‘spoke’ to your father, and you waited in the
drawing-room, half dead with alarm, as you made
me believe?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” I cried, “and how my father used to
say that you won his heart by your very beginning.
‘I can’t talk about it, sir,’ you said, ‘but you see, sir,
you can; and will you?’”</p>

<p>We laughed together as we are never tired of laughing
tenderly over that, and I remembered tenderly too
the old blue and white drawing-room with the spindle-legged
chairs and the stiff curtains where I had
waited breathlessly that night in my flowered delaine
dress, while Pelleas “spoke” to father. I was
trembling when he came back, I recall, and he took
me in his arms and kissed away my fear. And
some way the thought of the girl in the flowered delaine
dress who was I and of the eager, buoyant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
young lad who was Pelleas must have shone in the
faces of us both when we entered our drawing-room
now, reverently, as if to meet our long-gone selves.</p>

<p>He was a fine, handsome fellow,—Eric Chartres,
this young lover of Lisa’s, and their sweet confusions
and dignities were enchanting. Pelleas and I sat
on the red sofa and beamed at them, and the little
fire tossed and leaped on the hearth, and the shadows
gathered in the corners and fell upon us; and on
Lisa and her lover the firelight rested.</p>

<p>What a wonderful hour it was for our plain drawing-room,
for so many years doomed to be merely
the home of talk about war and rumours of war and
relatives and their colourless doings and even about
matches made for shadowy lovers whom it never
might see. And now the room was called on to
harbour Young Love itself. No wonder that the
sober bindings on the shelves tried in the yellow firelight
to give news from their own storied hearts that
beat with the hearts of other lovers. No wonder
that the flowers on the mantel looked perilously like
a bridal wreath. At last, at last the poor room long
deprived of its brightest uses was habited by Young
Love.</p>

<p>Presently Pelleas startled me from my reverie.</p>

<p>“It’s twenty past five,” he murmured, “and no tea.”</p>

<p>So Nichola intended to do as she pleased, and she
was pleased to send no tea at all, and the rose was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
but a sop to Cerbera. And I had so counted on
seeing those young lovers in the delicate intimacy of
their first tea. But even in that moment of my disappointment
the stair door creaked and then I heard
her coming up, one step at a time, so that I knew her
to be laden with the tray.</p>

<p>Pelleas hastened to open the door for her and we
were both fain to gasp with astonishment. For in
Nichola came splendid in the newest and bluest of
dresses with—wonder of all!—a white cap and
apron to which only very stately occasions can persuade
her. And when she had set the tray on the
table I had much ado to keep from grasping her
brown hands. For she had brought the guest-silver,
my Royal Sèvres, my prettiest doilies and O, such thin,
white, chicken sandwiches, such odorous tea and thick
cream, and to crown all a silver dish of bonbons.</p>

<p>I tried to look my gratitude to her and I saw her
standing by the fire tranquilly inspecting Lisa’s
young lover and pretty Lisa herself who was helping
him to place my chair. And it may have been a
trick of the firelight, but I fancied that I detected on
Nichola’s face that expression of the morning, as if
her features were a little out of drawing, by way of
bodying forth some unwonted thought. Then very
slowly she rolled her arms in her crisp white apron
as she had done in the morning and very slowly she
began to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“My father had many goats in Capri,” she said
again, “and one Summer I went with him to buy
more. And at noon my father left me in the valley
while he went to look at some hill flocks. As for
me I sat by a tree to eat my lunch of goat’s cheese
and bread, and a young shepherd of those parts
came and brought me berries and a little pat of sweet
butter and we shared them. I did not see him again,
but now I have made you a little pat of sweet butter,”
said Nichola, nodding.</p>

<p>We were all silent, and Pelleas and I were spellbound;
for it was as if this old, withered, silent
woman had suddenly caught aside her robe and had
looked into her own heart and given us news of its
ancient beating. Old Nichola to have harboured
such an hour of Arcady as this! And at that moment
she turned to me with a kind of fury.</p>

<p>“For the love of heaven,” she cried terribly, “why
sit there stock-still till the crumpets are stone cold
and the tea as red as the tail of a fox? Eat!”</p>

<p>She was out of the room like a whirlwind and
clattering down the stairs. And for a moment we
all looked silently in each other’s faces and smiled
a little—but tenderly, as if some unknown lover
had lifted his head from his grave.</p>

<p>Thereafter we drank our tea very happily and
Lisa’s young lover, with his whole heart in his eager
face, told us quite simply of his love for her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
begged us to help him. And we all well-nigh
laughed and cried together at the bright business of
life.</p>

<p>When the shadows had quite fallen and the young
lover was gone and Lisa had slipped away to her
room to be alone, Pelleas and I sat long before the
fire. Nichola’s rose, fading in my lace, gave out a
fragrance to which some influence in the room was
akin; and we both knew.</p>

<p>I said: “Pelleas, I have been remembering that
morning long ago at Miss Deborah Ware’s—and
our Fountain of Gardens. When we were twenty-something,
like Lisa and Eric.”</p>

<p>“But so have I been thinking of that!” Pelleas
cried. And we nodded, smiling, for we love to have
that happen. Perhaps it makes us momentarily
believe that we are each other, and no aid asked of
science to bring it about. But now as I looked at
him I momentarily believed something else as well.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I began, “I am not sure—are you sure?
Has any one else really been here in the room, besides
us? Were Lisa and Eric really here—or have
we only been remembering?”</p>

<p>Pelleas was looking in the fire and he did not meet
my eyes.</p>

<p>“Lisa looks uncommonly like you, you know,” he
said.</p>

<p>“And that young Eric Chartres—O, indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Pelleas, he is not unlike you as you looked the very
night that you ‘spoke’ to father. Dear,” I said,
“perhaps those two have not been here at all. <i>Perhaps
it was we ourselves.</i>”</p>

<p>He looked at me swiftly; and “Pooh!” said he
enigmatically; but Pelleas’ doubt of charming
things is always like belief.</p>

<p>I dare say many would feel that what we suspect
is manifestly impossible. Besides, we have never
actually admitted that we do suspect. But we are
old and we have seen much magic.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">A FOUNTAIN OF GARDENS</p>

<p>Indeed, to have remembered that morning at Miss
Deborah Ware’s was enough to bring back to us the
very youth of which the morning was a part. It
seems to Pelleas and me that most of the beautiful
things that have come to us have been a part of our
old age, as if in a kind of tender compensation. But
that beautiful happening of our youth we love to remember,
the more because it befell in the very week
of our betrothal. And though our betrothal was
more than fifty years ago, I suppose to be quite truthful
that there is very little about those days that I
do not recall; or if there be any forgotten moments
I grieve to confess them. There are, however, I
find to my amazement, many excellent people who
conscientiously remember the dates of the Norman
Conquest and the fall of Constantinople, and who are
yet obliged to stop to think on what day their betrothal
fell. As for me I would far rather offend my conscience
in a matter of Turks than in a matter of love-knots.</p>

<p>On a delicate day in May, Eighteen Hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Forty-five, Pelleas and I were quite other people.
And I do protest that the lane where we were
walking was different, too. I have never seen
it since that summer; but I cannot believe that it
now wears anything like the same fabric of shadow,
the same curve of hedgerow or that season’s
pattern of flowers. The lane ran between the Low
Grounds and the property of the Governor, on one
side the thatched cots of the mill folk and the woodsmen,
and on the other the Governor’s great mansion,
a treasure-house of rare canvas and curio. That
morning the lane was a kind of causeway between
two worlds, and there was no sterner boundary than
a hedge of early wild roses. I remember how, stepping
with Pelleas along that way of sun, I loved him
for his young strength and his blue eyes and his
splendid shoulders and for the way he looked down
at me, but I think that he must have loved me chiefly
for my gown of roses and for the roses in my hat. For
I took very little account of life save its roses and I
must believe that a sense of roses was my most lovable
quality. We were I recall occupied chiefly in
gathering roses from the hedgerow to fill my reticule.</p>

<p>“Now, suppose,” Pelleas said, busy in a corner of
green where the bloom was thickest, “suppose we
were to find that the hedges go on and never stop, and
that all there is to the world is this lane, and that we
could walk here forever?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>I nodded. That was very like my conception of
the world, and the speculation of Pelleas did not
impress me as far wrong.</p>

<p>“Do you wish this morning could last forever,
Etarre, do you?” asked Pelleas, looking down at
me.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I truthfully, “I do.” I hope that
there is no one in the world who could not from his
soul say that at least once of some hour of Spring and
youth. In such a moment, it is my belief, the spirit
is very near entering upon its own immortality—for
I have always held that immortality must begin at
some beautiful moment in this life. Though as for
me, at that moment, I confess myself to have been
thinking of nothing more immortal than the adorable
way that Pelleas had of saying my name.</p>

<p>“But by and by,” Pelleas went on, “I think we
would come to a garden. Who ever heard of a love
story without a garden? And it will be a ‘different’
garden from all the rest—the trees will be higher
and the shadows will be made differently and instead
of echoes there will be music. And there will be
fountains—fountains everywhere; and when one
has gone in the garden a fountain will spring up at
the gate and no one can get out—ever. What do
you think of that for a garden?” asked Pelleas.</p>

<p>“I think,” said I, “that the garden we will come
to will be Miss Deborah Ware’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>For in fact I was carrying a message to Miss Deborah
Ware, a kinswoman of my mother’s, and I had
met Pelleas only by some heavenly chance as he
crossed the common.</p>

<p>“And who is Miss Deborah Ware?” asked Pelleas,
doubtfully, as if weighing the matter of entering her
garden.</p>

<p>“She owns a gold thimble,” I explained, “that
once belonged to Marie Antoinette. She prefers
wooden sabots to all other shoes. And she paints
most beautiful pictures.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Pelleas, enlightened, “so <i>that</i> is who
she is. And how does she look, pray?”</p>

<p>“I am certain that she looks like the Queen of
Sheba,” I told him. “And, moreover, all her caps
are crown-shaped.”</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> I know how the Queen of Sheba looked,”
cried Pelleas, triumphantly. “She looked like the
crowns of Miss Deborah’s caps. Do you happen to
know what the toll is to leave this lane?”</p>

<p>As I did not know—did anybody ever know?—and
as we were even then at the end of the lane, my
ignorance was rebuked and I paid the toll and I fancy
repeated the lesson—it was a matter of honour to
the sun and the wild roses not to let it be otherwise.
And we crossed the West Meadow by the long way
and at the last—at the very last, and nearly noon!—we
reached the cottage where Miss Deborah Ware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
had come to spend the Summer and engage in the
unmaidenly pursuit of painting pictures.</p>

<p>To tell the truth our Summer community of good
Knickerbocker folk were inclined to question Miss
Deborah’s good taste. Not that they objected to
the paint, but the lack of virtue seemed to lie in the
canvas. If Miss Deborah had painted candle-shades
or china porringers or watered silk panels or
flowerpots, no one, I think, would have murmured.
But when they learned that she painted <i>pictures</i>
they spread and lifted their fans.</p>

<p>“Miss Deborah Ware would ape the men,” they
said sternly. And when they saw her studio apron
made of ticking and having a bib they tried to remonstrate
with my mother, her kinswoman.</p>

<p>“She is a great beauty, for her age,” said the
women. “But Beauty is as Beauty does,” they
reminded her.</p>

<p>“Deborah does as Deborah is,” my mother answered,
smiling.</p>

<p>Miss Deborah was wearing the apron of ticking
that morning that we went to see her—Pelleas and I,
who were rather basely making her an excuse for the
joy of our morning together. But Miss Deborah
would have been the last to condemn that. She was
in a room overlooking the valley, and a flood of north
light poured on her easel and her idle palette. Miss
Deborah was breakfasting; and she explained that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
she had had a great fit for working very early; and
she gave us some delicious tea and crumpets.</p>

<p>“This is the tea,” she told us, “that Cupid and
Psyche always drank. At least I suppose that is
what the Japanese label says. Or perhaps it says
Aucassin and Nicolette.... I am a bit back in
my Japanese.” And immediately Miss Deborah
nodded at me a little and murmured that I crimsoned
as prettily as either of these ladies.</p>

<p>Then: “They tell me that you two are betrothed,”
she said, leaning back in her chair. “Why is that?”</p>

<p>At that I blushed again and so I have no doubt did
Pelleas, for we had not so much as said that word
in each other’s presence and to hear it pronounced
aloud was the most heavenly torture.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are very much in love,” she answered
her question meditatively. “Well, I believe
you. I believe you so thoroughly that I would like
to paint you. What barbarism it is,” she went on,
“that they don’t allow young lovers to have their
portraits painted together while they are betrothed!
Could there be a more delicious bit of history added
to any portrait gallery? And what if the marriage
never did come off—saving your presence? The
history might be all the more delicious for the separation,
and the canvas would be quite as valuable. I
am at this moment painting two dear little peasant
folk whose people flatter me by being delighted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
I think that I must really speak to your mother, child,
about painting you,” she said.</p>

<p>At that I stole a glance at Pelleas and surprised him
at the same pastime. And in that moment I do not
think that either the history or the taste of the portrait
greatly occupied us; for neither of us could pass
with serenity the idea of the sittings. Together,
mornings, in that still, sun-flooded studio. What
joy for those other lovers. In those days one had
only to mention an impossibly romantic situation for
Pelleas and me to live it out in imagination to its
minutest joy.</p>

<p>“Of course she will not consent,” Miss Deborah
added philosophically, “so if I were you I would
have another crumpet. My crumpets are considerably
better than my portraits. And my cook does
the crumpets.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward in her low chair, and Pelleas
and I looked at her in a kind of awe. She was like
mother’s Sweet-william that never would blossom in
the seed-book colours but came out unexpectedly in
the most amazing variegations. She sat with one
long, slim hand propping her face, a face attenuated,
whimsical in line, with full red mouth and eyes that
never bothered with what went on before them so long
as this did not obstruct their view.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that picture above your
heads?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>We looked, glad to be set at our ease. Then
Pelleas and I turned to each other in delicious
trepidation. For there on the wall of Miss Deborah’s
studio was a picture of the very garden that we two
had meant to find. We recognized it at once—our
garden, where Pelleas had said the Spring lane would
lead between the hedgerows and where the shadows
would fall differently and the echoes be long drawn
to music.</p>

<p>I cannot tell what there may have been about that
picture so to move us, and to this day I do not know
what place it strove to show. But, O, I remember
the green of it, the tender, early green, the half-evident
boughs of indeterminate bloom, the sense of
freshness, of sweet surprise at some meaning of the
year, the well, the shrine, the shepherd with his
pipes, the incommunicable spirit of rhythm and of
echo....</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” asked Miss Deborah smiling,
and I was abashed to find my eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>“I think that this,” Pelleas answered quaintly,
“will be the soul of Spring, Miss Deborah; and the
outdoors this morning will be the body.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” said Miss Deborah, nodding;
“though I fancy more things are souls than we give
them credit for,” she added.</p>

<p>Miss Deborah looked at us, her chin in her hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
And after a moment to our great amazement she
said:—</p>

<p>“I shall give you this picture for a wedding gift,
I think. And I tell you now so that if you are tempted
to break the engagement you will think twice. Is it
a picture that you want to live with?”</p>

<p>It was not only a picture that we wanted to live
with; it was a picture whose spell would be eternal.
And “Did you paint it, Miss Deborah?” we asked in
our simplicity.</p>

<p>Miss Deborah shook her head and named a great
name, then just beginning to be reverenced.</p>

<p>“He paints pictures better than his cook makes
crumpets,” she said, “and the quality is not usual.
Spend the day with me,” she added abruptly. “I
would like you to see the little lovers who are sitting
for my ‘Betrothed.’ I will send a message to your
mother, Etarre. Sit there while I work. I like to
think of you there.”</p>

<p>Whereupon she went off to her easel before the
north light, and Pelleas and I sat in the quiet room
with our Wonderful Picture and talked of it.</p>

<p>“There must be such a place,” said Pelleas
simply, “or he wouldn’t have painted it. He <i>couldn’t</i>,
you know. There must be a place a little like it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a little like it,” I assented, “with the fountain
at the gate the way you said.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be wonderful to find it?” Pelleas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
went on. “To come upon it quite suddenly when we
didn’t know. In Etruria, or Tuscany, or Tempe.”</p>

<p>Yes, it would be wonderful and before all things
wonderful.</p>

<p>“We would know it at once,” he added. “We
would have to know it, whatever way we came, by the
well or by the path or by the shrine.”</p>

<p>Yes, we agreed, we would have to know it. What
wonder to step together over that green with the
rhythm and echo of the pipes to lure us to the way.
If once we found it we would never leave it, we settled
that, too. For this was the week of our betrothal,
and it did not occur to us that one must seek more
than gardens. So we talked, and in the mists of our
happy fancy Pelleas suddenly set a reality that
made our hearts beat more joyously than for their
dreams.</p>

<p>“Think, dear,” he said, “this picture will hang in
our home.”</p>

<p>It would—it would. We looked at it with new
eyes. In our home.</p>

<p>Eventually Miss Deborah Ware came back, one
hand in the pocket of her ticking apron.</p>

<p>“You two make me think of that picture,” she said.
“That is why I have given it to you, I believe. It is
such a kind of heaven-and-earth place, with the upper
air to breathe, and what little ballast there is would
be flowers and pipes of Pan. But <i>I</i> don’t find fault<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
with that. Personally I believe that is the only
air there is, and I’m certain it’s the only proper ballast.
You recognize the place in the picture, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>We looked at each other in some alarm at the idea
of being told; but we ought to have trusted Miss
Deborah.</p>

<p>“‘A fountain of gardens,’” she quoted, “‘a well
of living waters and streams from Lebanon. Awake,
O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my
garden, that the spices may flow out.’ I don’t know
if that is what he meant,” she added, “but that is
what he painted. ‘Awake, O north wind; and come,
thou south,’ is undoubtedly what that shepherd is
piping. Come to luncheon. Perhaps we shall find
goat’s-milk cheese and Bibline wine and pure white
honey. In case we do not, would steamed clams
do?”</p>

<p>“Miss Deborah,” said Pelleas, as we followed
her down the studio, “we mean to go to that garden,
the real garden, you know. We’ve been saying so
now.”</p>

<p>In the studio door she turned and faced us, nodding
her understanding.</p>

<p>“Go there,” she said. “But whether you ever go
to the real garden or not, mind you live in this one.
And one thing more: Mind you pay your entrance
fee,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>At this, remembering as I do how our world was
stuff of dreams, I think that we both must have looked
a bit bewildered. <i>Entrance fee.</i> What had our
fountain of gardens to do with an entrance fee?</p>

<p>“You don’t know what that means?” she said. “I
thought as much. Then I think I must ask you to
promise me something.”</p>

<p>She went across the hall to the dining-room, and we
followed wondering.</p>

<p>“Just you keep the picture,” said Miss Deborah
Ware, “until it will make some one else happier than
it makes you. And then give it away. Will you
remember? Do you get the idea of the entrance fee
to the garden? And you promise? It’s just as I
thought—we’ve steamed clams instead of ambrosia.
Are you sorry you stopped?”</p>

<p>It was a very merry luncheon. I remember chiefly
the epergne of clematis, and the border of the wall
paper done in crocuses, and the sun flooding through
leaded glass. Those were the days when an epergne
of clematis and a border of crocuses and the like
seemed to me to be inclusive of the law and the
prophets, and I felt a luxury of pity for every one
who had not this special grace of understanding. I
think that I even felt a little stir of pity for Miss
Deborah Ware. Yes, I decided, Miss Deborah was
like mother’s Sweet-william that would not blossom
in the colours of the seed catalogue but showed forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
amazing hues of its own. Such as that entrance fee
to Arcady.</p>

<p>We lingered at table until Miss Deborah’s two
models were announced—the two who were sitting
for her “Betrothed.”</p>

<p>“They are adorable little people,” she said. “You
must see them before you go. They make me think
of ripe apples and robin redbreasts and mornings in
the country. Even if it were not so I would like
them for their shyness. The little maid—her name
is Mitty Greaves—is in the prettiest panic every
time I look at her; and Joel, the young lover, actually
blushes when the clock strikes.”</p>

<p>She went away to the studio and Pelleas and I
looked at each other in sudden abashment to find
ourselves together, taking our coffee alone. It might
have been our own table in a land of clematis,
beside our very fountain of gardens itself. Pelleas
stretched his hand across the table for mine, and we
lingered there in magnificent disregard of coffee until
the sun slanted away and the sweet drowsiness of
the afternoon was in the garden. Then we wandered
back to the studio and sat in the window-seat opposite
our Wonderful Picture and in murmurs disposed
for all time, as we thought, of that extraordinary
promise which Miss Deborah had demanded.</p>

<p>“This picture,” Pelleas said solemnly, “never
could make anybody so happy as it makes us. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
it <i>is</i> our garden that we planned in the lane this
morning.... The picture will always bring back
this morning to us, Etarre. It is our garden. It
<i>couldn’t</i> be the same to any one else.”</p>

<p>“If we were to give it to any one, Pelleas,” I recall
saying, “it must be to some one who would understand
what the garden means better than we.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he assented; “some one who walks there
all day long. Some one who ‘walks in beauty’ all
the time.”</p>

<p>Thereafter we fancied ourselves standing by the
shrine and looking in the well, and we saw our dreams
take shape in the nebulous fall of the fountain. Of
our betrothal week it seems to me that that hour is
sweetest to recall when I sat throned in the window-seat
in my gown of roses, and Pelleas at my feet
talked of our life to be. I think that there came to
us from the wall the sound of the piping in our
garden. Perhaps, although we had not then seen
their faces, the mere presence of those other lovers
was a part of our delight.</p>

<p>Presently Miss Deborah Ware pushed aside the
curtain in the far end of the studio.</p>

<p>“Now they are going to rest for a little,” she said,
“and I must go down to the kitchen. But you may
go about, anywhere you like.”</p>

<p>It fell so silent in the studio that Pelleas and I
fancied those other lovers to have gone out through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the glass doors into the garden. And when Pelleas
proposed that we go to the north window and look
away over the valley I think that we must have believed
ourselves to be alone in the studio. At all
events I recall that as we went up the room, lingering
before a cast or a sketch or a bit of brass, Pelleas had
slipped his arm about me; and his arm was still
about me when we stood before the north window
and he said:—</p>

<p>“Etarre—have you thought of something? Have
you thought that some day we shall stand before the
picture of our garden <i>when we are old</i>?”</p>

<p>This was a surprising reflection and we stood looking
in each other’s eyes trying to fathom the mystery
which we have not fathomed yet, for even now we
go wondering how it can be that we, who <i>were</i> we,
are yet <i>not</i> we; and still the love, the love persists. I
know of nothing more wonderful in the world than
that.</p>

<p>But to youth this thought brings an inevitable
question:—</p>

<p>“Will you love me then as much as you love me
now?” I asked inevitably; and when Pelleas had
answered with the unavoidable “More,” I dare say
that I promptly rebuked him with youth’s “But
could you love me more?” And I am certain that
he must have answered with the usual divine logic of
“No, sweetheart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>By which it will be seen that a May day in Eighteen
Hundred and Forty-five was as modern as
love itself.</p>

<p>Then for no reason at all we looked toward the
west window; and there in the embrasure across
the width of the great room were standing Mitty
Greaves and Joel, Miss Deborah’s little lover-models,
and both Mitty’s hands were crushed in Joel’s hands
and he was looking into her lifted eyes as if he were
settling for all time some such question as had just
been gladdening us.</p>

<p>They did not see us. And as swiftly as if we had
been the guilty ones, as indeed we were, we stole back
to the other end of the studio, breathless with our
secret. We felt such fellowship with all the world and
particularly the world of lovers that so to have surprised
them was, in a manner, a kind of delicious
justification of ourselves. It was like having met
ourselves in another world where the heavenly principle
which we already knew maintained with a
heavenly persistence.</p>

<p>“I dare say,” murmured Pelleas joyously, “I dare
say that they think they love each other as much as
we do.”</p>

<p>We were sitting in the window-seat, a little awed
by our sudden sense of being sharers in such a universal
secret, when Miss Deborah came back and
forthwith summoned us all before the open fire. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
had brought a great plate of home-made candy,
thick with nuts.</p>

<p>“Mitty and Joel,” she said leisurely, “shall I tell
you a secret? You are not the only ones who are in
love. For these two friends here are like to be married
before you are.”</p>

<p>Dear little Mitty in her starched white muslin
frock—I can see her now, how she blushed and
lifted her shy eyes. Mitty was the daughter of a
laundress in the Low Grounds and I remember the
scrupulous purity of her white, threadbare gown.
Miss Deborah had told us that her very hair
looked ironed and that it had long been her opinion
that her mother starched her flaxen braids.
And Joel, in his open-throated blue blouse,
could no more have kept the adoration from
his eyes when he looked at Mitty than he could
have kept his shifting brown hands quiet on
his knees. They belonged to the little wild-bird
people, a variety that I have since come to love and
to seek out.</p>

<p>“And why,” Pelleas asked then, “are we likely
to be married first? For I’m afraid we have a whole
year to wait.”</p>

<p>I recall that Miss Deborah tried to turn aside that
question by asking us quickly how we had been amusing
ourselves; and when Pelleas told her that we had
been sitting before our Wonderful Picture she talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
about the picture almost as if she wished to keep
us silent.</p>

<p>“Up at the Governor’s house,” said Miss Deborah,
“they have wanted for years to buy it. The Governor
saw it when I had it in town. But the picture
is yours now, for all that. Don’t you think that is
a pretty picture, Mitty?” she asked.</p>

<p>At this little Mitty looked up, proud and pleased
to be appealed to, and turned shyly to our Wonderful
Picture—the picture that gave Pelleas and me a
new sense of happiness whenever we looked at it;
and she said with an hesitation that was like another
grace:—</p>

<p>“Yes’m. It’s the loveliest green, all over it. It’s
the colour of the moss on the roof of our woodshed.”</p>

<p>Ah, poor little Mitty, I remember thinking almost
passionately. Why was it that she was shut out
from the kind of joy that came to Pelleas and me in
our picture? It was as if their love were indeed of
another world, in another sense than we had thought.
For this picture that had opened a kind of paradise
to us was to these other lovers merely suggestive of
Mitty’s woodshed roof down in the Low Grounds.</p>

<p>“Shall you be married by the autumn?” Pelleas
asked of them then somewhat hurriedly.</p>

<p>And at that Miss Deborah fell silent as if she had
done her best to make us understand; and Mitty
answered him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” she said hesitatingly. “You see,
it’s Joel’s father—he’s hurt in the woods—a tree
fell on him—he can’t ever work no more, they think.
And so Joel’s got the family for a while.”</p>

<p>“Joel’s got the family for a while.” We knew
what that meant, even before Pelleas’ sympathetic
questioning brought out the fact that six were dependent
on him, boy that he was, with his own
right to toil. He talked bravely, even buoyantly, of
his prospects on his pittance at the mill. And little
Mitty listened and looked up at him adoringly and
faced with perfect courage the prospect of those years
of loneliness and waiting. As I heard them talk and
as their plans unfolded shyly in the warmth of our
eager interest, I think there came to me for the first
time the sad wondering that must come upon us all:
How should it be that Pelleas and I had so much and
they so little? how should it be that to us there were
the Spring lanes, the May roses, the fountain of
gardens—and to them the burden of the day?</p>

<p><i>To us the fountain of gardens.</i> The thought was
as poignant as a summons. Ay, to us the joy of the
garden, the possession of its beauty; and why then,
since we possessed its spirit, should the mere magic of
the canvas be ours? We could part with that and
by no means lose our garden, for the garden would
be ours always. But the value that the world would
set upon the picture itself, the value that they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
set upon it at the Governor’s house where were walls
of rare canvas and curio—was this what Miss Deborah
had meant, I wondered? Here on the day
that we had received it were there come two to whom
Miss Deborah’s gift would give greater happiness
than to us?</p>

<p>I looked at Pelleas and I think that in that moment
was worked our first miracle of understanding,
and to this day we do not know to whom the wish
came first. But Pelleas smiled and I nodded a little
and he knew and he turned to Miss Deborah; and
I leaned toward Mitty and spoke most incoherently
I fear, to keep her attention from what Miss
Deborah should say. But for all that I heard perfectly:—</p>

<p>“Would it be enough?” Miss Deborah repeated.
“Dear boy, the picture would keep the whole family
like kings for a year. Since you ask me, you know.”</p>

<p>And Pelleas turned to me with a barely perceptible—</p>

<p>“Shall we, Etarre?”</p>

<p>And I made him know that it was what I would
have above all other things, if Miss Deborah was
willing. And as for Miss Deborah, she leaned back
in her low chair, her eyes shining and a little pink
spot on either cheek, and she said only:—</p>

<p>“I told you! I tell everybody! It’s you heaven-and-earth
kind of people with a ballast of flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
that know more about your entrance fee to the garden
than anybody else.”</p>

<p>We wondered afterward what she could have
meant; for of course there could be no question of
our having paid an entrance fee to our garden in the
sense that she had intended, since what we were proposing
to do was to us no payment of a debt or a fee,
but instead a great happiness to us both.</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Miss Deborah, that they want it
for the Governor’s house <i>now</i>?” Pelleas asked in
sudden anxiety.</p>

<p>“They were here again yesterday to ask me,”
Miss Deborah assured us; and I think there was a
certain radiance in her face.</p>

<p>So Miss Deborah told Mitty and Joel—dear little
maid, dear honest young lover; shall I ever forget
the look in their eyes when they knew? And, remembering,
I am smitten with a kind of wonderment
at the immortality of the look of happiness in
another’s eyes. For many and many a time when
Pelleas and I have been stepping through some way
of shadow we have, I know, recalled the look on
those luminous young faces; and we have said to each
other that life can never be wholly shadowed or
wholly barren while there remain in the world wistful
faces to whom one may bring that look. It is so
easy to make eyes brighten, as I hope every one in
the world knows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>And so our fountain of gardens tossed up such a
rainbow as the happiness of Mitty and Joel—Mitty
with the starched flaxen braids and Joel with the
brown shining face to whom the picture had suggested
only the green of a woodshed roof. Pelleas
and I had quite forgotten that we had meant to give
the picture to some one who should understand the
garden better than we—one who should “walk
in beauty.” Something of the significance of this
stirred vaguely in our thought even then; but I think
that we have since come to regard this change of purpose
as holding one of the meanings of life.</p>

<p>Mitty and Joel left Miss Deborah’s house just before
us, and Pelleas and I lingered for a moment in
her doorway.</p>

<p>“That young artist,” said Miss Deborah, “who
paints pictures better than his cook makes crumpets—I
shall write to him to-night. I shall tell him that
even if he never paints another picture he will not
have been an artist in vain.” She leaned toward us,
smiling and nodding a little. “There will be other
entrance fees,” she said; “watch for them.”</p>

<p>We went up the twilight lane that led between the
Governor’s treasure-house of canvas and curio and
the thatched cots of the Low Grounds. Save for the
shadowy figures of Mitty and Joel walking before us,
and waving their hands at the lane’s turning, nothing
was changed since the morning. Yet now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
spirit of the place lived not only in its spell of bloom
but it lived also in us. Some door had been opened
and we had entered.</p>

<p>When we reached the upper meadow, Pelleas
suddenly caught my hand.</p>

<p>“Ah, look—look, Etarre!” he cried.</p>

<p>In the dimness the meadow lay, all of tender, early
green, like that of our Wonderful Picture, with half-evident
boughs of indeterminate bloom pleasant with
freshness and with sweet surprise at some meaning
of the year.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said, “I think, if we look, the well
and the shepherd with his pipes will be over there.”</p>

<p>“And the shrine,” Pelleas said.</p>

<p>We stood at the stile, and it seemed to us that the
dusk had shaped itself to be our garden at whose gate,
when one has entered, a fountain will spring so that,
as Pelleas had said, “no one can get out—ever.” At
the last we looked long in each other’s eyes. And
I think that we read there the secret of the garden
that lies not in Etruria, or Tuscany, or Tempe; and
we knew its living waters and its spices and its incommunicable
spirit of rhythm and of echo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE BABY</p>

<p>Our grandniece, Enid, is older than Lisa, her
sister. Indeed, Enid was twenty-two that Spring,
and had been for two years happily married in spite
of the fact that Pelleas and I had had no hand in the
wooing. To see Enid with her baby in her arms was
considerably like watching a wild rose rock a butterfly,
and no one can fancy how tenderly we two observed
her. I think that few sweet surprises of experience
or even of wisdom have so confirmed our
joy in life as the sight of our grandniece Enid with
her baby.</p>

<p>It chanced that when the baby was but a few weeks
old David, Enid’s young husband, was sent to The
Hague upon some government business, a state of
affairs for which it seemed to Pelleas and me that
the United States should be called to account. For
experience shows that the government will go irresistibly
forward but I protest that the baby’s father
never can be compensated for that absence; and I
would like to have any one object who can believe
differently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>For all his impatience to see whether the little child
had grown to manhood in those six weeks or so, David
was obliged to report at Washington immediately
upon his return. When the steamship was almost
due Enid found that she could wait for him to see
the baby not one day longer than that on which the
boat was to arrive. So she took train from somewhere
in Connecticut with that very little child and
arrived at our house in a sad state of collapse, a
few minutes before her telegram. Enid has no
nurse maid. They are very young married people
indeed.</p>

<p>The night on which Enid and her baby reached
us Pelleas and I had been sitting in the dark of our
drawing-room, with the fire almost burned out. It
was one of the nights when all the little shadows that
live near come creeping forth. They came when
we were not aware and there they were in the room,
saying nothing. The ghosts that come to the platforms
of Elsinore do not often speak.</p>

<p>“We dreamed it differently, Etarre,” Pelleas had
said.</p>

<p>I knew what he meant. Have we not all dreamed
it differently? And then we sat thinking of the
Great Dream which we had had and lost. For
there was a time, when Pelleas could model and I
could write so that a few were deceived, that the
Great Dream for one radiant year was in our home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
and went away when little Cedric died. In all the
years since then we have gone wondering where he
may be now, and where now, without us. For he
was so very tiny when he left us; he could hardly
take a step alone even by clinging to my finger, with
Pelleas’ hands outstretched before him. I think
it is partly lest he be needing us as he needed us then
that we are never very far from him in thought, and
that night we talked long of him until one by one all
the other shadows went away in the presence of his
little figure on our hearth.</p>

<p>So we were sitting with “Do you remember?”
and “But do you remember?” on our lips when
the door-bell rang and Nichola came upstairs to
answer it, talking all the way. We wondered
somewhat, for we have no unexpected visitors and
no small excitements. We wondered the more when
she appeared on the threshold of the drawing-room,
bearing in her arms a white bundle which wore
long and alarmingly fluffy skirts.</p>

<p>“Nichola!” we both cried; for you do not know
how pleasant it is when the days grow colourless to
have something happen which you yourself did not
bring about. “Nichola! What is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a babby,” Nichola informed us grimly, and
laid it in Pelleas’ arms—face downward, he afterward
told me. Then she beckoned me to the hall and
I went, barely able to stand; for I was certain that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
had been left in a basket on the steps with nothing
but a locket.</p>

<p>“Nichola,” I begged, “whose baby?”</p>

<p>Nichola was bending over the bench where sat poor
little Enid, crying helplessly.</p>

<p>“N—nobody told me,” Enid sobbed on my
shoulder, “what it would be like to travel with a
ten-weeks-old baby. He cried every m—mile of
the way here—and he is a good baby, too!”</p>

<p>Bless the little mothers. I have never yet known
one who would not assure you, though in the presence
of a child exhibiting a most dreadful temper, that
her baby was “usually so good, too.”</p>

<p>Together, though I suppose that I hindered far
more than I helped, Nichola and I got Enid upstairs
and put her in bed, dear little thing, hardly more
than a baby herself for all her wise use of the most
advanced baby terms. Nichola hurried downstairs
and in a few minutes bustled back with a steaming
bowl of some mysterious compound, hot and
savoury in a bowl. How do some people always
know what to bring you, hot and savoury, in a bowl?
If I had gone down to the kitchen I protest that I
could have devised nothing but eggs.</p>

<p>Nichola insisted on feeding Enid—the impertinent
old woman had observed that when I am excited
my hands tremble. But whose do not? As for
Nichola I had often told her that she would not show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
emotion if an army with banners were to march in
the front door. Instead of fear or sorrow or agitation
Nichola’s way of emotion is anger; and I
should have expected her to remind such an army of
the purpose of the door mat.</p>

<p>“You’d best,” Nichola said to me over her shoulder,
“go downstairs and see after that—babby.”</p>

<p>Nichola dislikes a great many things, but the greatest
of these dislikes is babies. When she passes one
in its perambulator I have seen her take the extreme
edge of the walk.</p>

<p>“They ain’t a bone in ’em,” she once explained;
“when you go to pick ’em up, they <i>slimpse</i>.”</p>

<p>I deplored this failing of Nichola’s as I hurried
downstairs to Pelleas, but I was chiefly concerned to
know how he had got on in my absence—Pelleas,
who will not even hold my Angora.</p>

<p>No sound came from the drawing-room. I entered
fearfully, for even a man of genius is sometimes
helpless. I have never known my own alarm more
swiftly rebuked.</p>

<p>He had managed to turn on the lights and furthermore
he had contrived to take off the baby’s cloak
and bonnet and veil, though usually he could as easily
embroider a thing as to untie it, save after a very
long time. And there sat Pelleas on the sofa with
the baby in one arm, and he was gravely holding a
lighted match a foot from its face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>As I looked he threw the burned match in the grate,
soberly lighted another and repeated the performance.
Evidently he construed some movement of the baby’s
face to be an answering smile, for he looked vastly
pleased and encouraged and instantly said clearly:—</p>

<p>“Well, tol, tol, tol, tolly tol! Yes!” And then
added in a tone of the simplest conviction, “Of
course.”</p>

<p>I hurried forward, laughing at him in spite of the
sudden lump in my throat. It is sad for Pelleas to
be nobody’s grandfather when he looks so precisely
like a grandfather on the stage.</p>

<p>“What are the matches for, Pelleas?” I cried.</p>

<p>He looked up with the adorably abashed expression
that I love to bring to his eyes.</p>

<p>“They keep its attention,” he murmured apologetically,
“nothing else would. I think it’s hungry.”</p>

<p>“‘It’!” I cried scornfully; “why, it’s a boy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well now,” Pelleas argued placidly, “you said
‘It’s a boy.’ And I said, ‘It’s hungry.’ What’s the
difference?”</p>

<p>And to this there was really no response.</p>

<p>The baby’s disturbed babbling waxed to a steady
fretting which increased in volume and violence.
Hungry he undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>I remembered that Enid’s black bag lay on the
bench in the hall. I hurried to it, and there was the
baby’s empty bottle. When I came back, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Pelleas was lighting matches at a furious rate, the
baby was crying at the top of his small strength.</p>

<p>“He’ll disturb Enid,” I said. “Pelleas,” I added,
as one proposing revolutions, “we must take the
baby down to the kitchen and feed him.”</p>

<p>You to whom such sweet offices are the joy—or
the burden!—of every day, what can you know of
the thrill of that moment to one whose arms have
been empty for so long? I protest that holding the
keys to The Hague and all Europe and the other continents
is not to be compared to the radiant responsibility
of that moment.</p>

<p>Pelleas promptly stood up and extended his arms.</p>

<p>“Take it,” he said, with enchanting masculine
helplessness. Pelleas will not even let me carry my
primroses up and down stairs, but merely because
this was a baby he resigned his rights. I had almost
forgotten how humble men are in such a presence.</p>

<p>I took the baby in my arms, and he settled down
with that contented little gurgle which always attends
a baby’s changing hands, most subtilely
flattering the new nurse until the storm breaks afresh
harder than before. This the storm did next, and I
looked at Pelleas a little wildly. For whatever was
to be done I must do.</p>

<p>“Go first,” said I firmly, “and open the kitchen
door.”</p>

<p>I followed him down the stairs, one foot at a time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
and when he opened the door the sight warmed my
heart. The kitchen was cheery and brightly lighted,
a hot fire was blazing in the range, and the teakettle
was singing away to make the most miserable
at peace. Sometime I shall write a letter to those
who are of all men the bluest, and the substance of
it will be: Go and put on the teakettle.</p>

<p>I sat by the fire while Pelleas, by devious ways of
pantry and refrigerator, sought out the milk, and we
were very merry over warming it, for it was a wonderful
occasion. Pelleas spilled a great deal of milk
on Nichola’s perfectly polished griddles—O, I
could not have loved him if in such a pleasant experience
his hands had been perfectly firm and indifferent.
Nichola’s hands would have been quite
firm. That brown old woman has no tremors and
no tears. And just as Pelleas had filled the baby’s
bottle, she appeared at the stair door.</p>

<p>“The babby’s mother,” she said, folding her arms,
“says you’d know about mixin’ in the lime water an’
the milk sugar, an’ boilin’ the bottles up, an’ washin’
out the babby’s mouth with carbolic acid.”</p>

<p>“Nichola!” we gasped.</p>

<p>“That’s what she says,” Nichola maintained
firmly, “some kind o’ acid. I think she says her
Aunt Septy told her. She says I’s to tell you or the
babby’d starve. The young leddy acts like a cluck-chicken.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>When she had gone back upstairs Pelleas and I
looked in each other’s faces.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten,” I said weakly, “Pelleas, they
boil <i>everything</i> now.”</p>

<p>“They do?” said Pelleas helplessly.</p>

<p>“And they use two <i>separate</i> bottles,” I recalled
anxiously. “And they—”</p>

<p>Pelleas wrinkled his eyes at the corners.</p>

<p>“Fudge!” he said.</p>

<p>O, I loved Pelleas for that “Fudge!” Not that I
do not believe in every improvement in the world.
I do. And Pelleas holds the most advanced doctrines.
But now and then I do love a “Fudge!”</p>

<p>“Would you dare give him this warm milk?” I
asked him bravely.</p>

<p>“I certainly would dare,” Pelleas answered clearly;
“we would take the baby to ride in an automobile,
would we not? and as for danger—”</p>

<p>“But, Pelleas,” I hesitated, “I don’t like to think
we’re behind the times, undermining the progress
of Society and Science and—”</p>

<p>By then the displeasure of the baby was like that
of a young god, neglected of Hebe. Pelleas handed
me the bottle.</p>

<p>“I am the last not to sympathize with these details,”
he said gravely, “but it’s hungry, Etarre.
Feed it. The situation seems to require something
more than a boiled bottle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>So, being unregenerate, we hesitated no longer.
And Pelleas sat beside me, and the baby drank with
little soft, shuddering breaths at the painful memory
of how hungry he really had been. I bent above
him and so did Pelleas, our heads quite close together
as we watched him, and heard the little soft noises
and sighs and met the eyes’ grave, wondering criticism.
So long, so long it had been since I had seen
that one serious eye lifted to mine as a little face
lay against my breast.</p>

<p>Pelleas put out one finger and the funny little hand
caught it and clung to it. Pelleas wrinkled his eyes
at the corners and smiled up at me—I had almost
forgotten how he used to do that and then wait for
me to tell him that at that rate I could never get
Cedric to sleep. When Pelleas did that now we
sat silent; for very little babies are never unlike,
and if I had really let myself I might have
imagined and so I think might Pelleas have imagined
... that which for more than forty years
we have only dreamed.</p>

<p>At last the baby moved his head, gurgled a brief
grace, stared up at us unwinkingly, and then wrinkled
his face astoundingly. Pelleas rose and looked
wildly about for matches. One would have said that
we were fugitives from justice crouching behind a
panel and that our safety depended upon keeping
that baby quiet during the passing of the men-at-arms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
I cannot tell how it is with others, but when
one is seventy a baby affects one like this and to prevent
it crying seems all the law and a fair proportion
of the prophets. So that when Pelleas came with
a box of paraffin matches and lighted whole handfuls
before Enid’s baby’s eyes I said very little; for
he did stop crying, though he looked at these humble
pyrotechnics somewhat haughtily and as if he knew
more about them than he cared to give out.</p>

<p>The stair door does not creak, and this time
Nichola was quite in the kitchen before we heard
her. She looked at us once and then hurried to the
other side of the room and busied herself at the
dresser. We have seldom seen Nichola laugh but,
if it were not that we cannot imagine her laughing,
I would have thought and Pelleas would have thought
that her voice sounded ever so slightly muffled.</p>

<p>“Its mother wants it right straight off,” she remarked,
with her back toward us.</p>

<p>We rose promptly, and meekly made our way upstairs.
Old Nichola dictates to us all day long in
matters in which, as I think, we are really far wiser
than she; how then should we not yield in crises of
which we may be supposed to know nothing?
Though I am bound to confess that save in matters of
boiling I felt myself as wise as little Enid who, as I
have said, is a baby herself. And this suggests something
about which I have often wondered, namely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
when the actual noon of motherhood may be? For
I protest it seems to me that all the mothers of my
acquaintance are either themselves babies, or else I
catch myself thinking that they are too old and even
spinsterish in their notions to be able perfectly to
bring up a child. Yet it cannot very well be that I
was the only mother neither too young nor too old to
train youth properly.</p>

<p>I laid the little thing in Enid’s bed, and Enid
smiled—that tender, pitiful, young-mother smile
which somehow breaks one’s heart no matter
how happy the young mother may be. But I
was certain that the baby would disturb her.
And an hour later while the doctor was with
her an idea came to me that set me in a delicious
flutter. I had forgotten that there are such
sweet excitements in the world. I hugged the hope
in silence for a moment and then shared it with
Pelleas.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” I said, “that Enid should need her
rest to-night?”</p>

<p>I looked at him tentatively, expecting him to understand
at once as he almost never fails to do. I
did not remember that it is far easier to understand
in matters of design, rhythm and the like, which had
occupied us these many years, than to adjust one’s
self without preparation to the luminous suggestion
which I was harbouring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“I hope that she <i>will</i> have a good night,” Pelleas
advanced, with appalling density.</p>

<p>“But suppose,” I persisted, “that she should
need her rest and that the doctor thought the baby
would be certain to disturb her?”</p>

<p>“If it cries,” Pelleas suggested then with magnificent
generosity, “you might get it and rock it awhile.”</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried, “don’t you see? Maybe we
can have the baby with us all night.”</p>

<p>Pelleas looked up in surprise; then his dear face
shone.</p>

<p>“Could we, do you think?” he said, as we say when
we want a thing very much.</p>

<p>“We will,” I promised.</p>

<p>Therefore when we heard the doctor coming
downstairs we hurried to the hall and waited for
him at the foot of the stairs. Between us we must
have laid the matter before him, though I do not in
the least remember what we may have said; but
some way we made him know for he nodded and
smiled in a surprising fashion.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “yes—by all means! I really
am persuaded that it would be an act of charity for
you to keep that baby with you to-night.”</p>

<p>“On our niece’s account, you know,” said I with
dignity.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said he gravely, and caught up his
hat and rushed away. At the time it seemed to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
that he was curiously moved about something and I
feared that Enid might be very ill.</p>

<p>As for Pelleas and me we could hardly wait to go
upstairs. Of course Nichola had to know; she
brought up the milk and the alcohol lamp and we
were obliged to tell her. To tell Nichola that you
mean to do anything which she considers foolish is
very like a confession that your whole point of view
is ignorant and diseased. Still, in some fashion,
Pelleas and I together told her. Our old servant
regarded us with the disapprobation which it is her
delight not to disguise. Then on her brown fingers
she checked matters off.</p>

<p>“No sleep for neither one of you,” she cast up the
account. “Headaches to-morrow all day. Death
o’ cold dancin’ in an’ out o’ bed. An’ a smothered
babby by mornin’.”</p>

<p>“O, no, no, Nichola,” said we, gently but sweepingly.</p>

<p>I brought the baby in our room to undress him.
Our room was cheerful and warm. An open fire was
burning; and Pelleas had lighted all the candles as
we will do on the rare occasions when we are
dressing for some great event. On a table beside
the bed stood the alcohol lamp and the glasses and
the baby’s bottle—I had not even mentioned lime
water and boiled bottles to Enid—and strange
enough they looked where only my Bible and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
medicine have lived for so long. The baby was
asleep when we took him from Enid, but he waked
and smiled impartially and caught at the air in perfect
peace. I took off the little garments, feeling all
the old skill come back to my hands idle to all such
sweet business for more than forty years. Pelleas
insisted on drawing off the tiny socks and stockings
and when I saw the little feet in his palm I could
almost have believed, for one swift moment, that the
years had indeed rolled back. Then we wrapped
him warmly and laid him in the great bed. And
Pelleas spent a long while happily tucking in and
tucking down and pretending to be very useful.</p>

<p>We had thought to read for a little while as is our
wont and we did try to do so; but neither of us could
keep our eyes anywhere near the book or could listen
to the other read aloud. For the unwonted sound
of that soft breathing was wholly distracting. And
once a little hand was thrown up over the edge of
the covers. What did we care about the sculptures
at Ægina then?</p>

<p>Nichola looked in.</p>

<p>“Best leave a lamp burnin’,” she said crossly. “An’
if it should cry, you call me.”</p>

<p>By which, as Pelleas said afterward, she by no
means intended to provide for the possible emotion
of the lamp.</p>

<p>I was longing to feel that little head in the hollow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
of my arm. I laid it there presently and tucked my
hand between the two pillows as I had been wont
and held away the covering from the baby’s face.
There was the fine dark hair, and there was the tiny
hand uplifted and—as I live!—there was the identical
ruffle of lace which had always used to bother
about the little chin. In that first ecstatic moment
I looked up at Pelleas almost frightened, half-expecting
the buoyant, youthful face and the dear eyes
that were wont to look down upon Cedric and me.
And the dear eyes smiled, for they have never
changed.</p>

<p>I lay very still listening to that quiet breathing, to
the rustle and turning which is a tender language
of its own. When one is seventy and closes
one’s eyes it is wonderful how the whole world grows
youthful. And when I had almost dozed that
tender rustling brought me back so happily that I
could hardly tell which was memory of that other
little head upon my arm and which was now. At
midnight and twice later when the baby’s food had
to be warmed it was I who did this, and the old
familiar helplessness of Pelleas in this little presence
delighted me beyond measure. Though when the
baby grew impatient and cried, Pelleas valiantly
lighted matches before him, and he fell silent and
even smiled, and slept again. I record it as a mere
matter of history that in the intervals of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
ceremonies I had not slept for a moment. For
there had come thronging back such a company of
memories, such a very flight of spirits of the old
delight of our wonderful year when there was
Cedric, that the world had no room for sleep at
all. Sleep! I do not suppose that any one would
chide me for being wakeful at a ball? And nothing
in the world could have been so delightful to
me as were those hours when that little head lay
on my arm.</p>

<p>Sometime after daylight he awoke. Cedric had
been wont to lie quietly as long as ever I would do
so, but Enid’s baby—for it was Enid’s baby for all
our pretending—awoke and played with his fists.
Then a fancy that had hovered over me all the
night took shape, and I told it to Pelleas.</p>

<p>“Dear,” I said, “you know the things in the bottom
drawer in the closet?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered at once, “I have been thinking
about them.”</p>

<p>“Suppose,” I suggested, “that we were to—to
try some of them on the baby.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking the same thing,” Pelleas
said.</p>

<p>It was not cold in the room, for we had kept the
hearth alive all the night. When we were warmly
wrapped and had drawn chairs before the fire,
Pelleas brought from the closet that box filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the tender yellow muslins that Cedric had worn
such a little time. I chose the white batiste gown
that I had made myself, every stitch; and over his
little nightgown we put it on Enid’s baby. He
was very good, and crowed and nestled; and so
we found the long white cloak that I had embroidered
and a bonnet that Pelleas had once
selected himself, all alone, at a shop. And Enid’s
baby’s arm doubled up in a ball when I tried to
put it in a sleeve—I suppose that there never
was a baby’s arm that did not do this, but I have
known only one little arm. And when the pink
hand came creeping through the cuff Pelleas caught
it and kissed it—O, I had not thought for years
how he used to do that.</p>

<p>“Now!” I said, “Pelleas—look now.”</p>

<p>Enid’s baby sat on my knee, his back to us both.
The little bent back in that white coat, the soft collar
crumpling up about the neck in spite of me, the same
little bonnet with the flower in the back and the lace
all around—</p>

<p>Pelleas and I looked at each other silently. And
not so much in grief as in longing that was like the
hope of heaven.</p>

<p>We did not hear Nichola coming with our coffee.
So she opened the door and saw the box on the floor
and the things scattered all about. She knew what
they were. She was with us when little Cedric was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
here, and she had not forgotten. She stood still, and
then set the tray down on the table.</p>

<p>“Drink your coffee!” she called sharply, and was
out of the room before we could speak.</p>

<p>In a moment, when I could, and because Enid’s
baby cried then I laid him in Pelleas’ arms and went
out to tell Nichola to bring more milk.</p>

<p>And leaning against a bureau in the passage
Nichola stood crying as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>“Go on away!” she said, shaking her old gray
head. “Go on away!”</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE MARRIAGE OF KATINKA</p>

<p>“I shall take my white lady’s-cloth gown,” I
repeated obstinately.</p>

<p>“You don’t need it no more than what you do
two heads, mem,” Nichola maintained.</p>

<p>“But it is the first visit that I’ve made in three
years, Nichola,” I argued, “and it is quite the
prettiest gown that I’ve had for—”</p>

<p>“Yah!” Nichola denied; “you’ve got four sides of
a closet hung full. An’ where you goin’ but down
on a farm for three days? Take the kitchen stove
if you must, but leave the dress here. You’ll be
laughed at for fashionable!”</p>

<p>I wavered, and looked consultingly at Pelleas.</p>

<p>It is one sign of our advancing years, we must
believe, that Pelleas and I dislike to be laughed
at. Our old servant scolds us all day long and
we are philosophical; but if she laughs at
either of us Pelleas grieves and I rage. Nichola’s
“You’ll be laughed at for fashionable” humbled
me.</p>

<p>Pelleas, the morning sun shining on his hair, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
picking dead leaves from the begonias in the window
and pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>I looked longingly at my white lady’s-cloth gown
but Nichola was already folding it away. It had
ruffles of lace and a chiffon fichu and was altogether
most magnificent. I had had it made for a winter
wedding and as it had not been worn since, I was
openly anxious to reappear in it. And now on
occasion of this visit to Cousin Diantha at Paddington
Nichola threatened me with remorse if I
so much as took it with me. I would be “laughed
at for fashionable!”</p>

<p>However, Pelleas continuing to pick dead leaves in
a cowardly fashion, there would have been no help
for me had not Nichola at that moment been called
from the room by the poultry wagon which drew up
at our door like a god from a cloud. Our steamer-trunk,
carefully packed, stood open before me with
room enough and to spare for my white lady’s-cloth
gown.</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried impulsively.</p>

<p>He looked round inquiringly, pretending to have
been until that moment vastly absorbed.</p>

<p>“If I put the gown in,” I cried excitedly, “will you
strap the trunk before she gets back?”</p>

<p>Pelleas wrinkled his eyes at the corners, and it was
the look that means whatever I mean.</p>

<p>In a twinkling the gown was out of its tissues and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
tumbled in place in a fashion which would have
scandalized me if I had been feeling less adventuresome.
Pelleas, whose hands could have trembled
with no more sympathy if he had been expecting to
appear in the gown too, fastened the straps and
turned the key and we hurried downstairs. On the
landing we met Nichola.</p>

<p>“The trunk is strapped, Nichola,” said I firmly.</p>

<p>“You needn’t to hev done that,” she grunted
graciously.</p>

<p>We passed her in guilty silence.</p>

<p>“If only there is actually a chance to wear the
gown,” I confided to Pelleas on the train that afternoon,
“it will make it all right to have taken it.”</p>

<p>“What a shocking principle, Etarre,” returned
Pelleas, quite as if he had not helped.</p>

<p>We were met at the Paddington station by something
which Cousin Diantha called “the rig.” It
was four-seated and had flying canvas sides which
seemed to billow it on its way. From an opening
in the canvas Cousin Diantha herself thrust
out a red mitten as the bony driver was conducting
us across the platform. Our Cousin Diantha
Bethune is the mince-pie-and-plum-pudding branch
of our family. We can never think of her without
recollecting her pantry and her oven. And
whereas some women wear always the air of having
just dressed several children or written letters or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
been shopping, Cousin Diantha seems to have been
caught red-handed at slicing and kneading and to
be away from those processes under protest. She
never reads a book without seeming to turn the leaves
with a cook knife and I think her gowns must all be
made with “apron fronts.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t this old times though?” she cried, opening
her arms to me, “ain’t it? Etarre, you set here by
me. Pelleas can set front with Hiram there. My!”</p>

<p>“The rig” rocked up the dingy village street with
us, its only passengers, buttoned securely within its
canvas sails so that I could see Paddington before
us like an aureole about the head of Pelleas. But
if a grate fire had been a-light in that shabby
interior it could have cheered us no more than did
Cousin Diantha’s ruddy face and scarlet mittens.
She gave us news of the farm that teemed with her
offices of spicing and frosting; and by the time we
reached her door we were already thinking in terms
of viands and ingredients.</p>

<p>“What a nice little, white little room,” said Pelleas
for example, immediately we had set our lamp on
our bureau. “The ceiling looks like a lemon pie.”
Verily are there not kitchen-cupboard houses whose
carpets resemble fruit jelly and whose bookcases
suggest different kinds of dessert?</p>

<p>Cousin Diantha was bustling down the stairs. She
never walked as others do but she seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
always hurrying for fear, say, that the toast was
burning.</p>

<p>“Baked potatoes!” she called back cheerily. “I
put ’em in last thing before I left, an’ Katinka says
they’re done. Supper’s ready when you are.”</p>

<p>I was hanging my white lady’s-cloth gown under
the cretonne curtain.</p>

<p>“Katinka,” I repeated to Pelleas in a kind of
absent-minded pleasure.</p>

<p>“It sounds like throwing down a handful of
spoons,” submitted Pelleas, wrinkling the corners
of his eyes.</p>

<p>We saw Katinka first when we were all about the
table—Cousin Diantha, Miss Waitie who was her
spinster sister, Pelleas and I, and Andy, who worked
for his board. I shall not soon forget the picture
that she made as she passed the corn cakes,—Katinka,
little maid-of-all-work, in a patched black frock and
a red rubber ring and a red rubber bracelet. Her
face was round and polished and rosy with health, and
she was always breathless and clothed with a pretty
fear that she was doing everything wrong. Moreover,
she had her ideas about serving—she afterward
told me that she had worked for a week at the
minister’s in Paddington where every one at breakfast,
she added in an awed voice, “had a finger bowl
to themself.” Cousin Diantha, good soul, cared
very little how her dainties were served so that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
table was kept groaning, and Katinka had therefore
undertaken a series of reforms to impress which she
moved in a mysterious way. For example, as she
handed the corn cakes and just as I raised my hand
to take one, steaming, moist, yellow and quite beneath
my touch, the plate was suddenly sharply
withdrawn, a spirited revolution of Katinka’s hands
ensued, and the cakes reappeared upon my other
side.</p>

<p>“We got the table set longways o’ the room to-night,”
she explained frankly, “and I can’t hardly
tell which <i>is</i> left till I look at my ring.”</p>

<p>Conversation with Katinka while she served was,
I perceived, a habit of the house; and indeed Katinka’s
accounts of kitchen happenings were only
second in charm to Katinka’s comments upon the
table talk. It was to this informality that I was
indebted for chancing on a radiant mystery on that
very night of our arrival.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Grocer Helman,” said Cousin Diantha to
me at this first supper—every woman in Paddington
has her husband’s occupation for a surname—“wants
to come to see you about making over her
silk. She’s heard you was from the city an’ she says
Mis’ Photographer Bronson’s used up the only way
she—Mis’ Grocer—knew on a cheap taffeta. Mis’
Grocer Helman won’t copy. She’s got a sinful
pride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Katinka set down the bread plate.</p>

<p>“I got some loaf sugar sent up from Helman’s
to-day,” she contributed, “because I just <i>had</i> to get
that new delivery wagon up here to this house somehow.
It’d been in front o’ Mis’ Lawyer More’s
twict in one forenoon.”</p>

<p>And at this Miss Waitie, who was always a little
hoarse and very playful, shook her head at Katinka.</p>

<p>“Now, new delivery wagon nothin’,” she said
skeptically; “it’s that curly-headed delivery boy, <i>I’ll</i>
be bound.”</p>

<p>So it was in my very first hour in Cousin Diantha’s
house that I saw what those two good souls had
never suspected. For at Miss Waitie’s words Andy,
who worked for his board, suddenly flushed one agonizing
red and spilled the preserves on the tablecloth.
What more did any sane woman need on
which to base the whole pleasant matter? Andy was
in love with Katinka.</p>

<p>I sat up very straight and refused the fish balls in
my preoccupation. My entire visit to Paddington
quickly resolved itself into one momentous inquiry:
Was Katinka in love with Andy?</p>

<p>“Is Katinka in love with Andy?” I put it to Pelleas
excitedly, when at last we were upstairs.</p>

<p>“Katinka? Andy? Andy? Katinka?” responded
Pelleas politely.</p>

<p>“Now, one would think you were never in love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
yourself,” I chided him, and fell planning what on
earth they would live on. Why are so many little
people with nothing at all to live on always in love—when
every one knows spinster after spinster with
an income apiece?</p>

<p>I was not long in doubt about Katinka. The very
next morning I came upon her in the hall, her arms
filled with kindling for the parlour fire. I followed
her. Her dear, bright little face and yellow braids
reminded me of the kind of doll that they never
make any more.</p>

<p>“Katinka,” said I, lingering shamelessly, “do you
put the sticks in across or up and down?”</p>

<p>For it may very well be upon this nice question
as well as Angora cats that Pelleas and I will have
our final disagreement, which let no one suppose that
we will really ever have.</p>

<p>She looked up to answer me. The gingham bib
of her apron fell down. And there, pinned to her
tight little waist, I beheld—a button-picture of
Andy! Never tell me that there does not abide in
the air a race of little creatures whose sole duty it is to
unveil all such secrets to make glad the gray world.
Never tell me that it is such a very gray world either,
if you wish my real opinion.</p>

<p>She looked down and espied the exposed mystery.
She cast a frightened glance at me and I suppose that
she saw me, who am a very foolish old woman, smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
with all my sympathetic might. At all events she
gasped and sat down among the kindling, and said:—</p>

<p>“Oh, ma’am, we’re agoin’ to be marrit to-morrow.
An’ Mis’ Bethune—I’m so scairt to tell ’er.”</p>

<p>I sat down too and caught my breath. This
blessed generation. I had been wondering if these
two were in love and on what they could live when
at last they should make up their minds and lo, they
were to be married to-morrow.</p>

<p>“Why, Katinka!” said I; “where?”</p>

<p>The little maid-of-all-work sobbed in her apron.</p>

<p>“I do’ know, ma’am,” she said. “Andy, he’s
boardin’ so, an’ I’m a orphing. I t’ought,” mentioned
Katinka, still sobbing, “maybe Mis’ Bethune’d
let us stand up by the dinin’-room windy. The
hangin’ lamp there looks some like a weddin’ bell,
Andy t’ought.”</p>

<p>The hanging lamp had an orange shade and was
done in dragons.</p>

<p>“When I see you an’ him las’ night,” Katinka
went on, motioning with her stubby thumb toward
the absent Pelleas, “I t’ought maybe you’d sign fer
seein’ it done. I tol’ Andy so. Mis’ Bethune, I
guess she’ll be rarin’. I wanted it to be in the
kitchen, but Andy, he’s so proud. His pa was in
dry goods,” said Katinka, wiping her eyes at the
mere thought.</p>

<p>Here was a most delicious business thrown, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
were, fairly in my arms. I hailed it with delight,
and sat holding my elbows and planning with all my
might.</p>

<p>“Katinka,” said I portentously, “you leave <i>where</i>
you are to be married to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ma’am!” said Katinka.</p>

<p>I never had more earnest appreciation.</p>

<p>Cousin Diantha Bethune was heard calling her
at that moment, and Katinka went off with the coals
quite as if the next day were not to see her a bride,
married in the parlour.</p>

<p>For I was determined that the wedding should be
in the parlour, and I spent a most feverish day. I
made repeated visits to the kitchen and held consultations
with the little maid, whose cheeks grew rosy
and whose eyes grew bright at the heaven of having
some one in the world interested in her.</p>

<p>While she washed the dishes she told me that she
and Andy had saved enough to live for three months
at Mis’ Slocum’s boarding house. After that the
future was a pleasant but indefeasible mystery.
While she cleaned the knives I slipped down to find
whether Andy had remembered to engage the parson;
and he had done so, but at the risk of having the
ceremony performed in the scullery as the only available
apartment. Andy, it appeared, objected to
being married at the parson’s house; and Katinka
seemed to think that this also was because his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
father had been “in dry goods.” At our last conference,
during lamp cleaning, I advised Katinka
to break the news to Cousin Diantha Bethune immediately
after supper when we were still at table.
Katinka promised and her mouth quivered at the
thought.</p>

<p>“She’ll never hev us in the parlour, not in this
world, ma’am,” she said to me hopelessly, “not with
that new three-ply ingrain on the floor.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had told Pelleas who, though he is
sometimes disposed to pretend to scoff at romance
which he does not himself discover, was yet adequately
sympathetic. At supper we were both absurdly
excited, and Pelleas heaped little attentions
on Andy who ate nothing and kept brushing imaginary
flies from before his face to show how
much at ease he was. And after the last plate
of hot bread had been brought in I wonder now
at my own self-possession; for I knew thereafter
that little Katinka, by the crack in the
pantry door, was waiting the self-imposed signal
of Cousin Diantha’s folded napkin. When this
came she popped into the room like a kind
of toy and stood directly back of Cousin Diantha’s
chair.</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am,” she said, “Andy an’ me’s goin’
to get marrit.”</p>

<p>Andy, one blush, rose and shambled spryly to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
side and caught at her hand and stood with glazing
eyes.</p>

<p>Cousin Diantha wheeled in her chair and her
plate danced on the table. My heart was in my
mouth and I confess that I was prepared for a dudgeon
such as only mistresses know when maids have
the temerity to wish to marry. In that moment I
found, to my misery, that I had forgotten every one of
my arguments about young love and the way of the
world and the durability of three-ply ingrain carpets,
and I did nothing but sit trembling and fluttering
for all the world as if it were my own wedding at
stake. I looked beseechingly at Pelleas, and he
nodded and smiled and rubbed his hands under the
tablecloth—O, I could not have loved a man who
would look either judicious or doubtful as do too
many at the very mention of any one’s marriage but
their own.</p>

<p>Dimly I saw Cousin Diantha look over her spectacles;
I heard her amazed “Bless us, Katinka!
What <i>are</i> you talking about?” And I half heard the
little maid add “To-morrow” quite without expression
as she turned to leave the room, loyally followed
by Andy. And then, being an old woman and no
longer able to mask my desire to interfere in everything,
I was about to have the last word when Cousin
Diantha turned to me and spoke:—</p>

<p>“Listen at that!” she cried; “listen at that! To-morrow—an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
not a scrap o’ cake in this house! An’
a real good fruit cake had ought to be three months
old at the least. I declare, it don’t seem as if a wedding
could be <i>legal</i> on sponge cake!”</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my ears. Not a word against
the parlour, no mention of the three-ply ingrain nor
any protest at all. Cousin Diantha’s one apprehension
was concerning the legality of weddings
not solemnized in the presence of a three-months-old
fruit cake. The mince-pie-and-plum-pudding
branch of our family had risen to the occasion as
nobly as if she had been steeped in sentiment.</p>

<p>Upstairs Pelleas and I laughed and well-nigh cried
about it.</p>

<p>“And Pelleas,” I told him, “Pelleas, you see it
doesn’t matter in the least whether it’s romance or
cooking that’s accountable so long as your heart is
right.”</p>

<p>So it was settled; and I lay long awake that night
and planned which door they should come in and
what flowers I could manage and what I could find
for a little present. Here at last, I thought triumphantly
as I was dropping asleep, was a chance to
overcome Nichola by the news that I had actually
found another wedding at which to wear my white
lady’s-cloth gown.</p>

<p>With that I sat suddenly erect, fairly startled from
my sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p><i>What was Katinka to wear?</i></p>

<p>Alas, I have never been so firmly convinced that I
am really seventy as when I think how I remembered
even the parson and yet could forget Katinka’s
wedding gown.</p>

<p>Immediately I roused Pelleas.</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried, “what do you suppose that
dear child can be married in?”</p>

<p>Pelleas awoke with a logical mind.</p>

<p>“In the parlour, I thought,” said he.</p>

<p>“But what will she wear, Pelleas?” I inquired
feverishly; “what can she wear? I don’t suppose
the poor child—”</p>

<p>“I thought she looked very well to-night,” he submitted
sleepily; “couldn’t she wear that?” And
drifted into dreams.</p>

<p>Wear <i>that</i>! The little tight black frock in which
she served. Really, for a man who is adorable,
Pelleas at times can seem stupid enough, though he
never really is stupid.</p>

<p>I lay for a little while looking out the high window
at the Paddington stars which some way seemed
unlike town stars. And on a sudden I smiled back
at them, and lay smiling at them for a long time.
For little Katinka was very nearly my size and I
knew what she was to wear at her wedding. My
white lady’s-cloth gown.</p>

<p>As soon as her work was done next morning I called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
her to my room. It was eleven o’clock and she was
to be married at twelve.</p>

<p>“Katinka,” said I solemnly, “what are you
going to wear, child, to be married in?”</p>

<p>She looked down at the tight little black gown.</p>

<p>“I t’ought o’ that,” said the poor little thing uncertainly,
“but I haven’t got nothink nicer than what
this is.”</p>

<p>She had thought of that. The tears were in my
eyes as I turned to the cretonne curtain and pulled
it aside.</p>

<p>“Look, Katinka,” I said; “you are going to wear
this.”</p>

<p>There hung the white lady’s-cloth in all its bravery
of chiffon and fichu and silver buttons. Katinka
looked once at that splendour and smiled patiently,
as one who is wonted to everything but surprises.</p>

<p>“La, ma’am,” she humoured me, pretending to
appreciate my jest.</p>

<p>When at last she understood, the poor little soul
broke down and cried on the foot of the bed. I know
of no sadder sight than the tears of one to whom they
are the only means of self-expression.</p>

<p>Never did gown fit so beautifully. Never was one
of so nearly the proper length. Never was such elegance.
When she was quite ready, the red ring
and red bracelet having been added at her request,
Katinka stood on a chair to have a better view in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
little mirror above my washbasin, and she stepped
down awe-struck.</p>

<p>“O, ma’am,” she said in a whisper, “I look like I
was ready to be laid out.”</p>

<p>Then she went to the poor, tawdry things of her
own which she had brought to my room, and selected
something. It was a shabby plush book decorated
with silk flowers and showing dog-eared gilt leaves.</p>

<p>“I t’ought I’d carry this here,” she said shyly.</p>

<p>I opened the book. And my eye fell on these
words written in letters which looked as if they had
been dropped on the page from a sieve:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There may be sugar and there may be spice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But you are the one I shall ever call nice.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was an autograph album.</p>

<p>“Why, Katinka,” I said, “what for?”</p>

<p>“Well,” she explained, “I know in the fashion
pictures brides allus carries books. I ain’t got no
other book than what this is. An’ this was mother’s
book—it’s all of hers I’ve got—and I t’ought—”</p>

<p>“Carry it, child,” I said, and little Katinka went
down the stairs with the album for a prayer-book.</p>

<p>And lo! as the door opened my heart was set beating.
For there was music; the reed organ in the
parlour was played furiously; and I at once realized
that Pelleas was presiding, performing the one tune
that he knows: The long-meter doxology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>The parlour blinds were open, the geraniums had
been brought up from the cellar to grace the sills, and
as crowning symbol of festivity Cousin Diantha had
shaken about the room a handkerchief wet with
cologne. Miss Waitie had contributed the presence
of her best dress. Andy, blushing, waited by the
window under the transferred wedding bell of dragons,
pretending to talk with the parson and continually
brushing imaginary flies from before his face. When
he saw Katinka he changed countenance and fairly
joined in the amazed “Ah!” of the others. Indeed
the parson began the ceremony with Andy’s honest
eyes still reverently fixed on Katinka’s gown.</p>

<p>There was but one break in the proceedings.
Pelleas, at Cousin Diantha’s urgent request attempting
to play softly through the ceremony,
reckoned without one of the keys which stuck
fast with a long, buzzing sound and could not
be released though every one had a hand at it.
And finally Katinka herself, who had dusted the
keyboard for so long that she understood it, had
to come to the rescue while the parson waited for
her “I will.”</p>

<p>As for me, by the time that it was all over I was
crying softly behind the stove with as much enjoyment
as if I had been Katinka’s mother. And not
until I bent my head to hide a tear did I perceive
that I had not changed my gown that morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
As if because one is seventy that is reason for
losing one’s self-respect!</p>

<p>Pelleas put the rest in my head.</p>

<p>“Etarre,” he said, while we were having cherry
sauce and seedcakes after the ceremony, “you’ve got
your gray gown, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said I, not understanding.</p>

<p>“And you don’t really need that white one....”
He hesitated.</p>

<p>I saw what he meant. We looked across at the
little bride, speechlessly happy in my old woman’s
finery.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” I said, loving Pelleas for his thought.</p>

<p>We smiled at each other with the tidings of a new
secret.</p>

<p>That is why, when we reached home three nights
later, we permitted Nichola to unpack our trunk
and had no fear. The white lady’s-cloth gown was
not there.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE CHRISTENING</p>

<p>The christening of Enid’s baby, delayed until
David’s return from Washington, was to be at our
house because Enid and her little son had already
come to us, but we, being past seventy, could not so
easily go up in Connecticut to Enid. At all events
that was what they told us, though Pelleas and I
smiled somewhat sadly as we permitted our age to
bear the burden of our indolence. Besides, I would
always be hostess rather than guest, for the hostess
seems essentially creative and the guest pathetically
the commodity.</p>

<p>Therefore on a day in May we rose early and found
our shabby drawing-room a kind of temple of hyacinths,
and every one in the room—by whom I mean
its permanent inhabitants—rejoicing. The marble
Ariadne, on a pedestal in a dark corner, guided her
panther on a field of jonquils which they two must
have preferred to asphodel; the Lady Hamilton
who lived over the low shelves folded her hands above
a very home of Spring; and once, having for a moment
turned away, I could have been certain that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
blindfold Hope above the mantel smote her harp
softly, just loud enough, say, for a daffodil to hear.</p>

<p>“Ah, Pelleas,” I cried, “one would almost say
that this is <i>The Day</i>—you know, the day that one
is expecting all one’s life and that never comes
precisely as one planned.”</p>

<p>“Only,” Pelleas supplemented positively, “this is
much nicer than that day.”</p>

<p>“Much,” I agreed, and we both laughed like
children waiting to be christened ourselves.</p>

<p>Pelleas was to be godfather—I said by virtue of
his age, but Enid, whose words said backward I
prefer to those of many others in their proper order,
insisted that it was by office of his virtue. There
were to be present only the Chartres’ and the
Cleatams, Miss Lillieblade and Lisa and Hobart
Eddy and a handful besides—all our nearest and
dearest and no one else; although, “Ah, me,” cried
Madame Sally Chartres while we waited, “haven’t
you invited every one who has lately invited <i>you</i> to a
christening?” And on, so to speak, our positive negative,
she added: “Really, I would have said that in
these social days no one is even asked to a funeral
who has not very recently had a sumptuous funeral
of her own.”</p>

<p>“Who was <i>my</i> godfather?” Pelleas asked morosely.
“I don’t think I ever had a godfather. I don’t know
that I ever was christened. Have I any proof that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
I was named what I was named? I only know it
by hearsay. And how glaringly unscientific.”</p>

<p>“You are only wanting,” cried Madame Polly
Cleatam, shaking her curls, “to be fashionably
doubtful!”</p>

<p>“Religions have been thrown away by persons
who had no more authentic doubts,” Pelleas gravely
maintained.</p>

<p>“I dare say,” Miss Lillieblade piped. “In these
days if a man has an old coat he puts on a new doubt,
and society is satisfied.”</p>

<p>Thereafter the baby arrived, a mere collection of
hand embroidery and lace, with an angel in the
midst of these soft billows. The baby looked quite
like a photograph made by the new school, with the
high lights on long sweeping skirts and away up at
the top of the picture a vague, delicious face. Our
grandniece Enid is an adorable little mother, looking
no less like a mermaid than does Lisa, but with a
light in her eyes as if still more of the mystery of the
sea were come upon her. And, as a mer-mother
should, she had conversation not exclusively confined
to the mer-child. I heard her on the subject
of prints with the bishop’s lady, and the mer-child was
not three months old.</p>

<p>The christening was to have been at eleven o’clock,
and at twelve Pelleas had an appointment which it
was impossible to delay, or so he thought, having a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
most masculine regard for hours, facts, and the like.
Therefore when, at fifteen after eleven, the bishop
had not yet arrived, Pelleas began uneasily suggesting
taking leave. Enid looked at him with a
kind of deep-sea-cave reproach before which every
one else would have been helpless; but Pelleas, whose
nature is built on straight lines, patted her and kissed
the baby at large upon the chest and, benign, was
still inexorable.</p>

<p>“But who will be godfather?” Enid cried disconsolately,
and, young-wife-like, looked reproachfully
at her young husband.</p>

<p>At that moment the hall door, as if it had been an
attentive listener as long as it could and must now
give the true answer, opened and admitted Hobart
Eddy, come late to the christening and arrived with
that vague air of asking why he was where he was
which lent to him all the charm of <i>ennui</i> without its
bad taste.</p>

<p>“Hobart,” Enid cried ecstatically, “<i>you</i> shall be
godfather!”</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy continued to bend to kiss my hand
and then sought the hand of Madame Sally and next
the hand of Madame Polly Cleatam. Finally he
bowed before Enid and fixed his monocle on the baby.</p>

<p>“It opens and shuts its eyes,” he earnestly observed;
“how these baby people imitate the doll
factories. It’s disgraceful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>“Kiss him!” the mer-mother commanded, as if
she were the prompter.</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy obediently kissed the baby’s thumb.</p>

<p>“Man and brother,” he greeted him solemnly;
“Lord, to think I’ll take it to luncheon sometime
and hear it know more about the town than I do.”</p>

<p>“At all events,” Madame Sally Chartres begged
gravely, “don’t ask him to lunch until he’s been
christened. In Society you have to have a name.”</p>

<p>“But,” Enid settled it with pretty peremptoriness,
“you must be godfather even if he never lunches.
Hobart—you will?”</p>

<p>“Its godfather?” said Hobart Eddy. “I? But
yes, with all pleasure. What do I have to do? Is
there more than one figure?”</p>

<p>When at length the arrival of the bishop followed
close on the departure of Pelleas, regretful but absurdly
firm, we were in a merry clamour of instruction.
The situation had caught our fancy and this
was no great marvel. For assuredly Hobart Eddy
was not the typical godfather.</p>

<p>“On my honour,” he said, “I never was even
‘among those’ at a christening, in my life, and I
would go a great distance to be godfather. It’s
about the only ambition I’ve never had and lost.”</p>

<p>The service of the christening holds for me a
poignant solemnity. And because this was Enid’s
baby and because I remembered that hour in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
he had seemed to be Pelleas’ dream and mine come
back, my heart was overflowingly full. But I missed
Pelleas absurdly, for this was one of the hours in
which we listen best together; and to have learned
to listen with some one brings, in that other’s absence,
a silence. But it was a happy hour, for the
sun streamed gayly across the window-boxes, there
were the dear faces of our friends, the mer-mother
and her young husband were near to joyful tears and
the bishop’s voice was like an organ chord in finer,
fluttering melody. Through the saying of prayer
and collects I stood with uplifting heart; and then
Enid’s husband gave the baby’s name with a boyish
tremble in his voice; and after the baptism and its
formalities the bishop read the words that were the
heart of the whole matter; and the heart of a matter
does not always beat in the moment’s uplift.</p>

<p>“<i>‘And thou, Child,’ the bishop read, ‘shalt be called
the prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before
the face of the Lord to prepare His ways.</i></p>

<p>“<i>‘Through the tender mercy of our Lord, whereby
the day spring from on high hath visited us.</i></p>

<p>“<i>‘To give light to them that sit in darkness and in
the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of
peace.’</i>”</p>

<p>As he read a hush fell upon us. It seemed suddenly
as if our conventional impulse to see Enid’s baby
christened was an affair of more radiant import than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
we had meant. From the words of exhortation that
followed I was roused by a touching of garments, and
I looked up to see a trim, embroidered maid holding
the baby toward Hobart Eddy. The moment for
his service as godfather was come. As he held out
his arms he questioned Enid briefly with his eyes,
and then earnestly gave himself to establishing the
little man and brother in a curve of elbow. It was
after all, I suppose him to have been reflecting,
as sternly required of a man that he be an
efficient godfather as that he perfectly fill all the
other offices of a man of the world. I even
suspected him of a downward glance to be assured
that the soft skirts were gracefully in place,
quite as if he were arranging <i>tableaux vivants</i>.
Thereafter he stood erect, with his complaisant
passivity of look, as perfectly the social automaton
as if the baby were a cup of tea. Really, to
accept dear Hobart Eddy as godfather was rather
like filling a champagne glass with cream.</p>

<p>“What shall be the name of this child?” once more
demanded the bishop.</p>

<p>“Philip Wentworth,” prompted the young father
a second time, presenting a serious, young-father
profile to the world.</p>

<p>The bishop waited.</p>

<p>“Philip Wentworth,” obediently repeated Hobart
Eddy with, I dare be sworn, the little deferential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
stooping of the shoulders with which I had seen him
return many and many a fan.</p>

<p>The bishop, his face filled with that shining which
even in gravity seemed sweeter than the smile of
another, fixed his deep eyes upon the godfather, and
when he spoke it was as if he were saying the words
for the first time, to the guardian of the first child:—</p>

<p>“‘Dost thou, in the name of this Child, renounce
... the vain pomp and glory of this world, with all
covetous desires of the same, and the sinful desires of
the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow nor be led by
them?’”</p>

<p>Hobart, his eyes fixed on the open prayer-book
which he held, read the response quickly and clearly:</p>

<p>“‘I renounce them all, and by God’s help I will
endeavour not to follow or be led by them.’”</p>

<p>“‘Wilt thou, then,’” pursued the bishop benignly,
“‘obediently keep God’s holy will and commandments
and walk in the same all the days of thy life?’”</p>

<p>“‘I will,’” said Hobart Eddy, “‘by God’s help.’”</p>

<p>There was no slightest hesitation, no thought,
or so it seemed to me; only the old urbane readiness
to say what was required of him. What had he said,
what had he done, this young lion of the social moment,
beau, gallant, <i>dilettante</i>, and was it possible
that he did not understand what he had promised?
Or was I a stupid and exacting old woman taking with
convulsive literalness that which all the world perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
recognizes as a form of promise for the mere
civilized upbringing of a child? I tried to remember
other godfathers and I could remember only those
who, like Pelleas, had indeed served, as Enid had
said in jest, by office of their virtue. And yet Hobart
Eddy—after all I told myself he was a fine, upright
young fellow who paid his debts, kept his engagements,
whose name was untouched by a breath of
scandal, who lived clear of gossip; so I went through
the world’s dreary catalogue of the primal virtues.
But what had these to do with that solemn “I
renounce them all”?</p>

<p>By the time that the service was well over I could
have found it in my heart to proclaim to our guests
that, as the world construed it, a christening seemed
to me hardly more vital than the breakfast which
would follow.</p>

<p>This however I forbore; and at the end every one
pressed forward in quite the conventional way and
besieged the baby and Hobart and showered congratulations
upon them both and kissed Enid and
was as merry as possible. And as for Hobart, he
stood in their midst, bowing a little this way and
that, giving his graceful flatteries as another man
gives the commonplaces, complaisant, urbane, heavy-lidded....</p>

<p>I omitted the baby and looked straight at the godfather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“How do you like the office?” I asked somewhat
dryly.</p>

<p>He met my eyes with his level look.</p>

<p>“Dear friend,” he said softly, “you see how inefficient
I am. Even to describe your charming
christening toilet is my despair.”</p>

<p>“Hobart Eddy,” said I sharply, “take Enid in to
breakfast.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While May was still stepping about the fields loath
to leave her business of violets and ladywort, Madame
Sally Chartres sent pleasant word from Long Island
that a dozen or more of her friends were to spend a day
with her, and no one would willingly disregard the
summons. The Chartres’ lived on the edge of an
orchard and another edge of field. I dare say they
lived in a house although what I chiefly remember is a
colonnade of white pillars, a library shelved to the
ceiling, and a sprinkling of mighty cushioned window
seats whereon the sun forever streamed through lattices.
Perhaps Madame Sally and Wilfred had assembled
these things near an orchard and considered that
to be house enough. At all events there could have
been no fairer place for a Spring holiday.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I went down by train, and the morning
was so golden that I wholly expected to divine a
procession of nymphs defiling faintly across the fields
in a cloud of blossoms rooted in air. I have often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
wondered why goblins, dryads and the like do not
more frequently appear to folk on railway trains.
These shy ones would be quite safe, for by the time
the bell rope should have been pulled and the
conductor told why the train must be stopped and
the engine and cars brought effectually to a standstill,
the little shadowy things could have vanished
safely against the blue. Perhaps they do not understand
how sadly long it takes a spirit to influence
the wheels of civilization.</p>

<p>The others coached down to the Chartres’ with
Hobart Eddy, although there must be made one important
exception: Madame Sally had insisted that
Enid bring the baby; and Enid and her husband,
who since the christening were lingering on in town,
had given the baby and his new nurse to the charge
of Pelleas and me. We arrived ahead of the coach
and stood on the veranda to welcome the others.</p>

<p>Lisa was among these, with Eric at her side; and
Madame Polly and Horace Cleatam and Miss Lillieblade,
all three in spite of their white hair and anxiety
about draughts stoutly refusing to ride inside.
There were four or five others, and from the box
seat beside Hobart Eddy I saw descending with
what I am bound to call picturesque deliberation a
figure whom I did not remember.</p>

<p>“Pray who is that?” there was time for me to ask
Madame Sally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“My dear,” she answered hurriedly, “she is a
Mrs. Trempleau. I used to love her mother. And
Hobart wanted her here.”</p>

<p>“Hobart!” I exclaimed. “That Mrs. Trempleau?”
I comprehended. “You don’t think ...”
I intimated.</p>

<p>Madame Sally’s eyebrows were more expressive
than the eyes of many.</p>

<p>“Who knows?” she said only, and made of her
eyebrows a positive welcome to our friends.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trempleau came toward us flickering prettily—I
protest that she reminded me of a thin flame,
luminous, agile, seeking. She had hair like the lights
in agate, and for its sake her gown and hat were of
something coloured like the reflection of the sun in
a shield of copper. She had a fashion of threading
her way through an hour of talk, lighting a jest here,
burning a bit of irony there, smouldering dangerously
near the line of daring. And that day as she moved
from group to group on the veranda the eyes of us
all, of whom Hobart Eddy was chief, were following
her. I think it may have been because her soul was
of some alien element like the intense, avid spirit of
the flames, though when I told Pelleas he argued that
it was merely the way she lifted her eyes.</p>

<p>“Where is <i>Mr.</i> Trempleau?” Pelleas added,
his nature as I have said being built on straight
lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“There may be one,” I answered, “but I think he
lives on some other continent.”</p>

<p>Pelleas reflected.</p>

<p>“Hobart Eddy and Pelham and Clox look in love
with her,” he said; “if she doesn’t take care there
won’t be enough continents.”</p>

<p>In no small amusement during luncheon we
watched Hobart Eddy, especially Pelleas and I who,
however, besides being amused, were also a little sad.
Mrs. Trempleau’s appropriation of him was insistent
but very pretty. Indeed, if she had on a night of
stars appropriated Sirius I dare say the constellations
would have sung approval. She had the usual
gift of attractive faults. But above Mrs. Trempleau’s
shoulders and beyond the brightness of her
hair I had, at luncheon, glimpses which effectually
besought my attention from the drama within. The
long windows overlooked the May orchards, white
and sweet and made like youth, and I was impatient
to be free of the woman’s little darting laughs and
away to the fields. Some way, in her presence it
was not like May.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Pelleas had been borne to the
stables by his host and when the others had wandered
back to the veranda, I went away down what I think
must have been a corridor, though all that I remember
is a long open window leading to the Spring, as if one
were to unlatch an airy door and reveal a diviner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
prospect than our air infolds. A lawn, cut by a
gravel walk bounded by tulips, sloped away from
this window to the orchard and I crossed the green in
the frank hope that the others would not seek me
out. But when I turned the corner by the dial I came
fairly on two other wanderers. There, with the
white-embroidered nurse-maid, sat, like another way
of expressing the Spring, Enid’s baby. Was ever
such happy chance befallen at the gate of any May
orchard whatever?</p>

<p>“Ah,” I cried to the little nurse, “Bonnie! Come
quickly. I see a place—there—or there—or there—where
you must bring the baby at once—at once!
Leave the perambulator here—so. He is awake?
Then quickly—this way—to the pink crab apple-tree.”</p>

<p>I sometimes believe that in certain happy case I
find every one beautiful; but I recall that Bonnie—of
whom I shall have more to tell hereafter—that
day seemed to me so charming that I suspected
her of being Persephone, with an inherited trick
of caring for the baby as her mother cared for
Demophoön.</p>

<p><i>To the pink crab apple-tree!</i> What a destination.
It had for me all the delight of running toward, say,
the plane tree in the meadow of Buyukdere. I
remember old branches looking like the arms of Pan,
wreath-wound, and rooms of sun through which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
petals drifted ... who could distinctly recall the
raiment of such an hour? But at length by many
aisles we came to a little hollow where the grass was
greenest, hard by the orchard arbour, and we stood
before the giant pink crab apple-tree. Has any
one ever wondered that Sicilian courtiers went out
a-shepherding and that the Round Table, warned to
green gowns, fared forth a-Maying?</p>

<p>“Spread the baby’s rug!” I cried to Bonnie;
“here is a little seat made in the roots for this very
day. Pull him a branch of apple blossoms—so.
And now run away, child, and amuse yourself. The
baby and I are going to make an apple-blossom pie.”</p>

<p>Bonnie, hesitating, at my more peremptory bidding
went away. I have no idea whether she was caught
up among the branches by friendly hands or whether
the nearest tree trunk hospitably opened to receive
her. But there, in May, with the world gone off in
another direction, the baby and I sat alone.</p>

<p>“O—o-o-o-o—” said the baby, in a kind of lyric
understanding of the situation.</p>

<p>I held him close. These hours of Arcady are hard
to win for the sheltering of dreams.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Voices, sounding beyond a momentary rain of
petals, roused me. Enid’s baby smiled up in my
eyes but I saw no one, though the voices murmured
on as if the dryads had forgotten me and were idly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
speaking from tree to tree. Then I caught from the
orchard arbour Mrs. Trempleau’s darting laugh. It
was as if some one had kindled among the apple
blossoms a torch of perfumed wood.</p>

<p>“I am sailing on Wednesday,” I heard her saying
in a voice abruptly brought to sadness. “Ah, my
friend, if I might believe you. Would there indeed be
happiness for you there with me, counting the cost?”</p>

<p>It was of course Hobart Eddy who answered quite,
I will be bound, as I would have said that Hobart
Eddy would speak of love: with fine deliberation, as
another man would speak the commonplaces, possibly
with his little half bow over the lady’s hand, a
very courtier of Love’s plaisance.</p>

<p>She replied with that perpetual little snare of her
laughter laid like a spider web from one situation to
the next.</p>

<p>“Come with me then,” she challenged him; “let
us find this land where it is always Spring.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” asked Hobart Eddy.</p>

<p>I do not know what she may have said to this, for
the new note in his voice terrified me. Neither do I
know what his next words were, but their deliberation
had vanished and in its stead had come something,
a pulse, a tremor....</p>

<p>I remember thinking that I must do something,
that it was impossible that I should not do anything.
I looked helplessly about the great empty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
orchard with its mock-sentinel trees, and down
into Enid’s baby’s eyes. And on a sudden I
caught him in my arms and lifted him high
until his head was within the sweetness of the
lowest boughs. He did what any baby in the
world would have done in that circumstance; he
laughed aloud with a little coo and crow at
the end so that anybody in that part of the orchard,
for example, must have heard him with delight.</p>

<p>The two in the orchard arbour did hear. Mrs.
Trempleau leaned from the window.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she cried, in her pretty soaring emphasis,
“what a picture!”</p>

<p>“Is he not?” I answered, and held the baby high.
On which she said some supreme nonsense about
Elizabeth and the little John and “Hobart—see!”
she cried.</p>

<p>The two came out of the arbour, and Mrs. Trempleau
made little dabs at the baby and then went
picturesquely about filling her arms with blossoms.
Hobart Eddy threw himself on the grass beside me
and watched her. I looked at them all: at the woman
who was like thin flame, at the man who watched her,
indolent, confident, plainly allured, and at Enid’s
baby. And,</p>

<p>“There,” said I, abruptly to the baby, “is your
godfather.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>Hobart Eddy turned on his elbow and offered him
one finger.</p>

<p>“It’s like being godfather to a rose,” he said
smiling, and his smile had always the charm and
spontaneity of his first youth.</p>

<p>“When the rose is twenty-one,” said I, “and this
luncheon party which I heard you prophesying the
other day comes off, what sort of godfather will you
be then, do you think?”</p>

<p>“What sort am I now, for that matter?” he asked
idly.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, then,” said I boldly; “yes! What
sort are you now?”</p>

<p>When one is past seventy and may say what one
pleases one is not accountable for any virtue of daring.</p>

<p>He looked at me quickly but I did not meet his eyes.
I was watching Mrs. Trempleau lay the apple boughs
against her gown.</p>

<p>“Ah, pray don’t,” he besought. “You make me
feel as if there were things around in the air waiting
to see if I would do right or wrong with them.”</p>

<p>“There are,” said I, “if you want me to be disagreeable.”</p>

<p>“But I!” he said lightly. “What have I to decide?
Whether to have elbow bits on the leaders
for the coaching Thursday. Whether to give Eric
his dinner party on the eighth or the nineteenth.
Whether to risk the frou-frou figure at Miss Lillieblade’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
cotillon. You don’t wish me to believe that
anything in the air is concerned with how I am
deciding those?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I with energy, “not in the air or on the
earth or under the sea.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, now,” he went on with conviction, and
gave to the baby a finger of each hand—beautiful,
idle, white fingers round which the baby’s curled
and clung, “what can I do?” He put it to me with
an air of great fairness.</p>

<p>With no warning I found myself very near to tears
for the pity of it. I laid my cheek on the baby’s
head and when I spoke I am not even sure that Hobart
Eddy heard all I was saying.</p>

<p>“... ‘in the name of this child,’” I repeated,
“was there not something ‘in the name of this child’—something
of renouncing—and of not following
after nor being led by....”</p>

<p>For a moment he looked up at me blankly, though
still with all his urbanity, his conformity, his chivalrous
attention.</p>

<p>“I’m not preaching,” said I briskly, “but a gentleman
keeps his word, and dies if need be for the
sake of his oath, does he not? Whether it chances
to be about a bet, or a horse, or—or a sea lion. For
my own part, as a woman of the world, I cannot
see why on earth he should not keep it about a
christening.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>Hobart Eddy turned toward me, seeking to free
his fingers of that little clinging clasp.</p>

<p>“Jove,” he said helplessly, “do they mean it <i>that</i>
way?”</p>

<p>“‘That way,’” I cried, past the limit of my patience.
“I dare say that very many people who are married
would be amazed if they were told that their oath
had been meant ‘that way.’ But they would sell
their very days to pay a debt at bridge. ‘That way!’
Let me ask you, Hobart Eddy, if ‘I will, by God’s
help’ does not mean quite as much at a marriage or a
christening as it does in society?”</p>

<p>And at that Enid’s baby, missing the outstretched
fingers, suddenly leaned toward him, smiling and
eager, uttering the most inane and delicious little
cries. A baby without genius would simply have
paid no attention.</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy took the baby in his arms and looked
down at him with something in his face which I
had never seen there before. The baby caught at
his hand and pulled at the cord of his monocle and
stared up at the low blossoming boughs. As for me
I fell gathering up stray petals in a ridiculous fashion
and I knew that my hands were trembling absurdly.</p>

<p>I looked up as Mrs. Trempleau came toward us.
She was dragging a burden of flowering branches
and she looked some priestess of the sun gone momentarily
about the offices of the blossoming earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, the baby!” she cried. “Let me have the
baby.”</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy had risen and had helped me to rise;
and I fancy that he and Enid’s baby and I hardly
heard Mrs. Trempleau’s pretty urgency. But when
she let fall the flowers and held out her arms,
Hobart looked at her and did not let the baby go.</p>

<p>“This little old man and I,” he said, “we understand
each other. And we’re going to walk together,
if you don’t mind.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Wednesday Mrs. Trempleau sailed for Cherbourg
alone. But when I told Pelleas the whole
matter he shook his head.</p>

<p>“If those two had intended eloping,” he said, “all
the christenings in Christendom wouldn’t have prevented.”</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I said, “I am certain—”</p>

<p>“If those two had intended to elope,” he patiently
began it all over again, “all the—”</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I urged, “I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p>“If those two—” I heard him trying to say.</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried finally, “<i>you</i> don’t believe it
either!”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, no,” he admitted, “I don’t know that
I do.”</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">AN INTERLUDE</p>

<p>We saw Mrs. Trempleau once afterward—it was
the following Autumn in the Berkshires—and of
that time I must turn aside to tell. But the story is of
Mrs. Trempleau’s little girl, Margaret.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I had gradually come to admit that
Margaret knew many things of which we had no
knowledge. This statement may very well be
received either as proof of our madness or as one
of the pastimes of our age; but we are reconciled
to having both our pastimes and our fancies disregarded.
We were certain that there are extensions
of the experiences of every day which we missed and
little Margaret understood.</p>

<p>This occurred to us the first time that we saw her.
We were sitting on the veranda of a boarding house
where we were come with Miss Willie Lillieblade to
be her guests for a week. The boarding house was
kept by a Quakeress, as famous for her asters as for
her pasties. Mrs. Trempleau, who was there when
we arrived (“She is like a flash of something, would
thee not say?” observed the gentle Quakeress, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
she calls the child only, thee will have marked, ‘Run
away now, Dearness.’”)—Mrs. Trempleau had just
driven away in a high trap with orange wheels and a
slim blond youth attached, when Margaret came up
to the veranda from the garden.</p>

<p>“Smell,” she said to me.</p>

<p>As I stooped over the wax-white scentless blossoms
in the child’s hand, I thought of that chorus of the
flower girls in one of the Italian dramas: “Smell!
Smell! Smell!”</p>

<p>“What are they, dear?” I asked, taking care
not to shake her confidence by looking at her.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said; “but O, smell!”</p>

<p>But though I held the flowers to my face I, who can
even detect the nameless fragrance of old lace, could
divine in them no slightest perfume. I held them
toward Pelleas, dozing in a deep chair, and when
he had lifted them to his face he too shook his head.</p>

<p>“It is strange,” he said; “I would say that they
have no odour.”</p>

<p>“They’ve such a beautiful smell,” said the child,
sighing, and took back her flowers with that which
immediately struck Pelleas and me as a kind of pathetic
resignation. It was as if she were wonted to
having others fail to share her discoveries and as if
she had approached us with the shy hope that we
might understand. But we had failed her!</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down here with us?” said I, dimly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
conscious of this and wistful to make amends. It is
a very commonplace tragedy to fail to meet other
minds—their fancies, their humour, their speculation—but
I am loath to add to tragedy and I always
do my best to understand.</p>

<p>We tried her attention that day with all that we
knew of fairy stories and vague lore. She listened
with the closest regard to what we offered but she
was neither impressed nor, one would have said,
greatly diverted by our most ingenious inventions.
Yet she was by no means without response—we
were manifestly speaking her language, but a language
about which Pelleas and I had a curious impression
that she knew more than we knew. It
was as if she were listening to things which she
already understood in the hope that we might let
fall something novel about them. This we felt
that we signally failed to do. Yet there was after all
a certain <i>rapport</i> and the child evidently felt at ease
with us.</p>

<p>“Come and see us to-morrow morning,” we begged
when she left us. For having early ascertained that
there was not a single pair of lovers in the house,
possible or estranged, we cast about for other magic.
In the matter of lack o’ love in that boarding house
we felt as did poor Pepys when he saw not a handsome
face in the Sabbath congregation: “It seems,”
he complained, “as if a curse were fallen upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
parish.” Verily, a country house without even
one pair of lovers is an anomaly ill to be supported.
But this child was a gracious little substitute and
we waited eagerly to see if she would return to us.</p>

<p>Not only did she return but she brought us food
for many a day’s wonder. Next morning she came
round the house in the sunshine and she was looking
down as if she were leading some one by the hand.
She lifted her eyes to us from the bottom step.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought my little sister to see you,” she said.</p>

<p>Then she came up the steps slowly as if she were
helping uncertain feet to mount.</p>

<p>“Halverson can’t get up so very fast,” she explained,
and seated herself on the top step holding
one little arm as if it were circling some one.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I looked at each other in almost shy
consternation. We are ourselves ready with the
maddest fancies and we readily accept the imaginings
of others—and even, if we are sufficiently
fond of them, their facts. But we are not accustomed
to being distanced on our own ground.</p>

<p>“Your—little sister?” said I, as naturally as I
was able.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she assented with simplicity, “Halverson.
She goes with me nearly all over. But she don’t like
to come to see peoples, very well.”</p>

<p>At this I was seized with a kind of breathlessness
and trembling. It is always wonderful to be received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
into the secrets of a child’s play; but here, we
instinctively felt, was something which Margaret
did not regard as play.</p>

<p>“How old is she?” Pelleas asked. (Ah, I thought,
even in my excitement and interest, suppose I had
been married to a man who would have felt it necessary
to say, “But, my dear little girl, there is no one
there!”)</p>

<p>“She is just as old as I am,” explained Margaret;
“we was borned together. Sometimes I’ve thought,”
she added shyly, “wouldn’t it ’a’ been funny if I’d
been made the one you couldn’t see and Halverson’d
been me?”</p>

<p>Yes, we agreed, finding a certain relief in the smile
that she expected; that would have been funny.</p>

<p>“Then,” she continued, “it’d ’a’ been Halverson
that’d had to be dressed up and have her face washed
an’ a cool bath, ’stead o’ me. I often <i>rish</i> it could
be the other way round.”</p>

<p>She looked pensively down and her slim little
hand might have been straying over somebody’s
curls.</p>

<p>“They isn’t no ’ticular use in bein’ <i>saw</i>,” she
observed, “an’ Halverson’s got everything else but
just that.”</p>

<p>“But can—can she talk?” Pelleas asked gravely.</p>

<p>“She can, to me,” the child answered readily, “but
I do just as well as more would. I can tell what she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
says. An’ I <i>always</i> understand her. She couldn’t be
sure other folks would hear her—right.”</p>

<p>Then the most unfortunate thing that could have
happened promptly came about. Humming a little
snatch of song and drawing on her gloves Mrs.
Trempleau idled down the long piazza. She greeted
us, shook out her lace parasol, and saw Margaret.</p>

<p>“My darling!” she cried; “go in at once to your
practicing. And don’t come out again <i>please</i> until
you’ve found a fresh hair ribbon.”</p>

<p>The child rose without a word. Pelleas and I
looked to see her run down the steps, readily forgetful
of her pretence about the little sister. Instead, she
went down as she had mounted, with an unmistakable
tender care of little feet that might stumble.</p>

<p>“Run on, Dearness! Don’t be so stupid!” cried
Mrs. Trempleau fretfully; but the child proceeded
serenely on her way and disappeared down the aster
path, walking as if she led some one whom we did
not see.</p>

<p>“She is at that absurd play again,” said the
woman impatiently; “really, I didn’t know she ever
bored strangers with it.”</p>

<p>“Does she often play so, madame?” Pelleas
asked, following her for a few steps on the veranda.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trempleau shrugged.</p>

<p>“All the time,” she said, “O, quite ever since she
could talk, she has insisted on this ‘sister.’ Heaven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
knows where she ever got the name. <i>I</i> never heard
it. She is very tiresome with it—she never forgets
her. She saves food for Halverson; she won’t go to
drive unless there is room for Halverson; she wakes
us in the night to get Halverson a drink. Of course
I’ve been to specialists. They say she is fanciful
and that she’ll outgrow it. But I don’t know—she
seems to get worse. I used to lock her up, but that
did no good. She insisted that I couldn’t lock Halverson
<i>out</i>—the idea! She has stopped talking the
nonsense to me, but I can see she’s never stopped
pretending. When I have my nervous headaches I
declare the dear child gives me cold chills.”</p>

<p>When she was gone Pelleas and I looked at each
other in silence. Between the vulgar skepticism of
the mother and the madness of believing that Margaret
saw what we did not see, we hesitated not a
moment to ally ourselves with the little girl. After
all, who are we that we should be prepared to doubt
the authority of the fancies of a child?</p>

<p>“They’ve been to <i>specialists</i>!” said Pelleas, shaking
his head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The night was very still, moonless, and having that
lack of motion among the leaves which gives to a
garden the look of mid-Summer. Pelleas and I
stepped through the long glass doors of our sitting
room, crossed the veranda and descended to the path.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
There we were wont to walk for an hour, looking
toward the fields where the farm-house candles
spelled out the meaning of the dark as do children
instead of giving it forth in one loud, electric word
as adults talk. That night we were later than
on other nights and the fields were still and black.</p>

<p>“Etarre,” Pelleas said, “of course I want to live
as long as I can. But more and more I am wildly
eager to <i>understand</i>.”</p>

<p>“I know,” I said.</p>

<p>“‘I want to see my universe,’” he quoted. “Sometime,”
he went on, “one of us will know, perhaps,
and not be able to tell the other. One of us may
know first. Isn’t it marvelous that people can talk
about anything else? Although,” he added, “I’m
heartily glad that they can. It is bad enough to hear
many of us on the subject of beer and skittles without
being obliged to listen to what we have to say
on the universe.”</p>

<p>I remember a certain judge who was delightful
when he talked about machinery and poultry and
Chippendale; but the moment that he approached
law and order and the cosmic forces every one hoped
for dessert or leave-taking. Truly, there are worthy
people who would better talk of “love, taste and the
musical glasses” and leave the universe alone. But
for us whose bread is wonder it is marvelous indeed
that we can talk of anything else. Nor do Pelleas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
and I often attempt any other subject, “in such a
night.”</p>

<p>“But I hold to my notion,” Pelleas said, “that we
might know a great many extraordinary things before
we die, if only we would do our best.”</p>

<p>“At all events,” said I, “we have at least got to be
willing to believe them, whether they ever come our
way or not. For I dare say that when we die we
shall be shown only as many marvels as we are prepared
for.”</p>

<p>“For example, Nichola—” suggested Pelleas.</p>

<p>At her name we both smiled. Nichola would not
believe in darkness itself if it did not cause her to
stumble. And she would as soon harbour an understanding
of, say, the way of the moon with the
tides as she would be credulous of witchcraft. Any
comprehension of the results of psychical research
would necessitate in Nichola some such extension of
thought as death will mean to Pelleas and me. The
only mystery for which she has not an instant explanation
is death; and even of that she once said:
“There ain’t much of anything mysterious about it,
as I see. It’s plain enough that we hev to be born.
An’ that we can’t be kep’ goin’. So we die.”</p>

<p>No, Nichola would not be prepared for the marvels
of afterward. The universe is not “her” universe.
But as for Pelleas and me no phenomenon could put
us greatly out of countenance or leave us wholly incredulous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
Therefore as we stepped across the lawn
in the darkness we were not too much amazed to
hear very near us a little voice, like the voice of some
of the little night folk; and obviously in talk with
itself.</p>

<p>“No, no,” we heard it saying, “I don’t fink it would
be right. No—it wouldn’t be the way folks ought
to do. S’posin’ everybody went and did so? With
theirs?”</p>

<p>It was Margaret. We knew her voice and at the
turn of the path we paused, fearing to frighten her.
But she had heard our talking and she ran toward
us. In the dimness I saw that she wore her little
pink bedrobe over her nightgown and her hair was
in its bedtime braids.</p>

<p>“Margaret—dear!” I said, for it was late and it
must have been hours since she had been left to
sleep, “are you alone?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “Halverson is here.”</p>

<p>She caught my fingers and her little hand was hot.</p>

<p>“Halverson wants me to change places with her,”
she said.</p>

<p>We found a bench and I held the child in my arms.
She was in no excitement but she seemed troubled;
and she drew her breath deeply, in that strange,
treble sigh which I have known from no other who
has not borne great sorrow. Have I said how beautiful
she was? And there was about her nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
sprite-like, no elfin graces, no graces of a kind of
angelic childhood such as make one fear for its
flowering. She had merely the beauty of the child
eternal, the beauty of normal little humankind.
That may have been partly why her tranquil talk
carried with it all the conviction which for some
the commonplace will have.</p>

<p>“Do you think I ought to?” she asked us seriously.</p>

<p>“But see, dear one, how could that be?” I said
soothingly. “What would you do—you and Halverson—if
you were indeed to change places?”</p>

<p>“I s’pose,” she said thoughtfully, “that I should
have to die an’ then Halverson would come an’ be
me. An’ maybe I might get lost—on the way to
being Halverson. But she begs me to change,”
cried the child; “she—she says I’m not happy. She—she
says if I was her I’d be happy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” said I, “but you are happy, are you
not?”</p>

<p>“Not very,” she answered, “not since papa went.
He knew ’bout Halverson, an’ he didn’t scold. An’
he never laughed ’bout her. Since he went I haven’t
had anybody to talk to—’bout <i>Them</i>.”</p>

<p>“About—whom?” I asked, and I felt for Pelleas’
hand in the darkness.</p>

<p>Margaret shook her head, buried against my arm.</p>

<p>“I can’t say Them,” she confessed, “because nobody
has ever told me about them, an’ I don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
how to ask. I can’t <i>say</i> Them. I can only see
Them. I fink my papa could—too.”</p>

<p>“Now?” I asked, “can you see—now, Margaret?”</p>

<p>“I can—when I want to,” she answered, “I—move
something in the back of my head. An’ then
I see colours that aren’t there—before that. An’
then I hear what they say—sometimes,” said the
child; “they make me laugh so! But I can’t ’member
what it was for. An’ I can hear music sometimes—an’
when flowers don’t smell at all I—do that way
to the back of my head an’ then the flowers are all
’fumery. I always try if other people can do that
to flowers. You couldn’t, you know.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “we couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the child, with her little sigh of resignation,
“nobody can. But I fink my papa could.
Well, an’ it’s <i>Them</i> that Halverson is with. She—I
think she <i>is</i> ’em. An’ she says for me to come an’
be ’em, too—an’ she’ll hev to be me then; ’cause
it isn’t time yet. An’ she’ll do the practicin’ an’ come
in for tea when mamma’s company’s there. She
says she’s sorry for me an’ she don’t mind bein’ <i>saw</i>
for a while. Would you go?”</p>

<p>“But how would you do it, dear—how could you
do it?” I asked, thinking that the practicality would
bring her to the actualities.</p>

<p>“O,” said Margaret, simply, “I fink I would just
have to move that in the back of my head long enough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
Sometimes I ’most have—but I was ’fraid an’ I
came back. Something ...” said the child, “something
slips past each other in the back of my head
when I want to....”</p>

<p>She threw her head against my breast and closed
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried, “O, Pelleas—take her! Let
us get her in the house—<i>quick</i>.”</p>

<p>She opened her eyes as his arms folded about her
to lift her.</p>

<p>“Don’t go so very fast,” she besought sleepily;
“Halverson can’t go so very fast.”</p>

<p>My summons at the door of Mrs. Trempleau’s
apartment brought no reply. Finally I turned the
knob and we entered. The outer room was in darkness,
but beyond a light was burning and there was
Margaret’s bed, its pillow already pressed as if the
little head had been there earlier in the evening.
Pelleas laid her down tenderly and she did not open
her eyes as I rearranged the covers. But when we
would have moved a little away she spoke in her clear,
childish treble.</p>

<p>“Please don’t go,” she said, “till Halverson gets
asleep. If she’ll only go to sleep I’m not ’fraid.”</p>

<p>On this we sat by the bed and she threw one arm
across the vacant pillow.</p>

<p>“Halverson sleeps there,” she said, “but sometimes
she keeps me ’wake with her dreams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>It may have been half an hour later when Pelleas
and I nodded to each other that, her restlessness
having ceased, she would now be safely asleep. In
almost the same moment we heard the outer door open
and some one enter the room, with a touch of soft
skirts. We rose and faced Mrs. Trempleau, standing
in the doorway. She was splendid in a glittering
gown, her white cloak slipping from her shoulders
and a bright scarf wound about her loosened hair.</p>

<p>We told her hurriedly what had brought us to the
room, apologizing for our presence, as well we might.
She listened with straying eyes, nodded, cast her
cloak on a sofa and tried, frowning, to take the
scarf from her hair.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she said in her high, irritable voice;
“thanks, very much. I’m sorry—the child—has
made a nuisance of herself. She promised me she’d
go to sleep. I went up to the ball—at the hotel.
She promised me—”</p>

<p>Her words trailed vaguely off, and she glanced up
at us furtively. And I saw then how flushed her
cheeks were and how bright her eyes—</p>

<p>“Margaret promised me she’d go to sleep,” she
insisted, throwing the scarf on the floor.</p>

<p>And the child heard her name and woke. She
sat up, looking at her mother, round-eyed. And at
her look Mrs. Trempleau laughed, fumbling at her
gloves and nodding at Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>“Dearness,” she said, “we’re going away from
here. You’ll have a new father presently who will
take us away from here. Don’t you look at mother
like that—it’s all right—”</p>

<p>Over the face of the child as Pelleas and I stood
helplessly looking down at her came a strangeness.
We thought that she was hardly conscious of our
presence. Her eyes seemed rather to deepen than
to widen as she looked at her mother, and the woman,
startled and unstrung, threw out her hands and
laughed weakly and without meaning.</p>

<p>“Mamma!” the child cried, “mamma!” and did
not take her eyes from her face, “O, mamma, you
look as if you had been dead forever—are you dead?
<i>You are dead!</i>” cried Margaret. “O, They won’t
touch you. They are running away from you.
You’re dead—dead,” sobbed the child and threw
herself back on her pillow. “O, papa—my papa!”</p>

<p>She stretched her little arm across the vacant
pillow beside her.</p>

<p>“Halverson, I will—I will,” we heard her say.</p>

<p>As soon as we could we got the little Quakeress,
for Mrs. Trempleau fainted and we were in a passion
of anxiety for the child. She lay without moving,
and when the village physician came he could tell us
nothing. We slipped away to our rooms as the East
was whitening and I found myself sobbing helplessly.</p>

<p>“She will die,” I said; “she knows how to do it—Pelleas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
she knows what we don’t know—whatever
it is we can’t know till we die.”</p>

<p>“Etarre!” Pelleas besought me, “I do believe she
has made you as fantastic as she.” But his voice
trembled and his hands trembled. And it was as
if we had stood in places where other feet do not go.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But Margaret did not die. She was ill for a long
time—at the last languidly, even comfortably ill,
able to sit up, to be amused. Mrs. Trempleau was
to be married in town, and on the day before the ceremony
Pelleas and I went in, as we often did, to sit
with Margaret. She was lying on a sofa and in her
hands were some white, double lilies at which she
was looking half-frowning.</p>

<p>“These don’t smell any,” she said to us almost at
once; “I thought they would. It seems to me they
used to smell but I can’t—find it now.”</p>

<p>She sat happily arranging and rearranging the blossoms
until some one who did not know of our presence
came through an adjoining room, and called
her.</p>

<p>“Margaret! Margaret!”</p>

<p>She did not move nor did she seem to hear.</p>

<p>“They are calling you, dear,” Pelleas said.</p>

<p>She looked up at us quickly.</p>

<p>“What did they call me before—do you remember?”
she said to us. “It wasn’t that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>Of the danger to the child I, in my sudden wild
wonder and curiosity, took no thought. I leaned
toward her.</p>

<p>“Was it Halverson?” I asked.</p>

<p>Her face brightened.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “somebody used to call me that.
Why don’t they call me that now? What did you
say the word is?”</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE RETURN OF ENDYMION</p>

<p>Pelleas and I went through the wicket gate with
a joyful sense of being invaders. The gate clicked
behind us, and we heard the wheels of our cab
rolling irretrievably from us, and where we stood
the June dusk was deep. We had let ourselves in by
a little wicket gate in the corner of the stone wall that
ran round Little Rosemont, the Long Island country
place where our dear Avis and Lawrence Knight lived.
We had come down for a week with them and,
having got a later train than we had thought, we
found at the station for Little Rosemont no one to
meet us. So there we were, entering by that woods’
gate and meaning to walk into the house as if we
belonged there. Indeed, secretly we were glad that
this had so befallen for we dislike arriving no less
than we dislike saying good-bye. To my mind
neither a book nor a visit, unless it be in uniform,
should be begun or ended with a ruffle of drums.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we would have our walk to the house,
a half-mile of delight. Before us in the pines was a
tiny path doubtless intended, I told Pelleas, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
used by violets when they venture out to walk, two
by two, in the safe night. It was wide enough to
accommodate no more than two violets, and Pelleas
and I walked singly, he before and I clinging to his
hand. The evergreens brushed our faces, we heard
a stir of wings, and caught some exquisite odour not
intended for human folk to breathe. It was a half-hour
to which we were sadly unwonted; for Pelleas
and I are nominally denied all sweet adventures
of not-yet-seventy, and such as we win we are wont
to thieve out-of-hand; like this night walk, on which
no one could tell what might happen.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said, “it is absurd to suppose that
we are merely on our way to a country house
for a visit. Don’t you think that this kind of
path through the woods always leads to something
wonderful?”</p>

<p>“I have never known it to fail,” Pelleas said
promptly. For Pelleas is not one of the folk who
when they travel grow just tired enough to take a kind
of suave exception to everything one says. Nor does
Pelleas agree to distraction. He agrees to all fancies
and very moderately corrects all facts, surely an
attribute of the Immortals.</p>

<p>Then the path-for-violets took a turn, “a turn and
we stood in the heart of things.” And we saw that
we had not been mistaken. The path had not been
intended for day-folk at all; we had taken it unaware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
and it had led us as was its fairy nature to something
wonderful.</p>

<p>From where we stood the ground sloped gently
downward, a tentative hill, not willing to declare
itself, and spending its time on a spangle of flowers.
We could see the flowers, for the high moon broke
from clouds. And in the hollow stood a little building
like a temple, with a lighted portico girt by white
columns and, within, a depth of green and white. We
looked, breathless, perfectly believing everything
that we saw, since to doubt might be to lose it. Indeed,
in that moment the only thing that I could not
find it in my heart to fall in with was the assumption
that we were in the New World at all. Surely, here
was the old order, the golden age, with a temple in a
glade and a satyr at your elbow. Could this be Little
Rosemont, where we were to find Avis and Lawrence
and Hobart Eddy and other happy realities of our
uneventful lives?</p>

<p>“Oh, Pelleas,” I said in awe, “if only we can get
inside before it disappears.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” murmured Pelleas, “if we can do that
we can disappear with it.”</p>

<p>For we have long had a dream—we are too frequently
besieged by the ways of the world to call it
a hope—that sometime They will come and take
us, the Wind or the Day or any of the things that we
love, and thus save us this dreary business of dying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>We skirted the edge of the wood, looking down the
while at that place of light. Within, figures were
moving, there was the faint music of strings, and
now and then we heard laughter. To complete our
mystification, as we were well in line with the white
portals there issued from the depth of green and
white a group of women, fair women in white gowns
and with unbound hair—and they stepped to the
grass-plot before the door and moved at the direction
of one who leaned, watching, in the white portico.
At that we hesitated no longer but advanced boldly
across the moonlit green. And when I saw that the
figure in the portico wore a frock of pink and when I
saw her lift her hand in a way sweetly familiar, I
began to suspect that the time was not yet come when
Pelleas and I were to vanish in such bright wise.
Manifestly Pelleas had come to the same conclusion,
for when he reached a broad, flat rock beneath a
birch he beckoned me to sit there in the shadow where
we could watch these strange offices.</p>

<p>But the broad, flat rock proved already to be occupied.
As we paused beside it there sprang to his
feet a boy who at first glance I protest to have
looked quite like a god, he was so tall and fair
under the moon. But in spite of that he instantly
caught at his cap and shuffled his feet in a fashion
which no god would employ.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said he in a voice that I liked, for all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
awkward shyness, “I was just sittin’ here, watchin’
’em.”</p>

<p>Pelleas looked at him closely.</p>

<p>“Are you sure,” demanded Pelleas, “that you are
not a shepherd who has conjured up all this, on
his pipe?”</p>

<p>He nodded toward the hollow and the young god
smiled, looking dreadfully embarrassed as a god
would look, charged with being a shepherd of dreams.
He had some green thing in his hand which as he
stood bashfully drawing it through his fingers gave
out a faint, delicious odour.</p>

<p>“Is that mandrake?” asked Pelleas with pleasure.</p>

<p>And to our utter amazement the god answered:—</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Squeeze it on your eyes and you can
see things a good ways off, they say.”</p>

<p>Shepherd or god, I liked him after that. I took
a bit of the mandrake from him and asked him
whether he had ever tried it and what he had seen;
but at this he blushed so furiously that as we moved
away Pelleas hastened to set him at his ease by some
crisp commonplace about the night. And there we
left him, standing under the birch with his mandrake
in his hand, looking down, I instantly guessed, for
some one in that brightness below us in the hollow.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said, “Pelleas, without any doubt
there is somebody down there whom he wants to see.
I dare say the temple may not be enchanted, after all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
For that fine young fellow and his blushes—they
seemed to me very human!”</p>

<p>“That’s the reason,” Pelleas said most wisely,
“why there is likely to be some enchantment about.
The more human you are the more wonderful things
are likely to happen.”</p>

<p>That is true enough, and it was in very human
fashion that next instant the figure in pink in the
portico of the temple came swiftly toward us and
took me in her arms. It was Avis, all tender regret
for what she fancied to be her inhospitality and as
perfectly the hostess as if it were usual for her to
receive her guests in a white temple. And manifestly
it was usual; for when she had led us
within, there on a <i>papier maché</i> rock on the edge
of a <i>papier maché</i> ocean sat Hobart Eddy himself
and Lawrence Knight in a dress as picturesque
as Hobart’s; and about them in a confusion of
painted idols and crowns and robes were all the
house-party at Little Rosemont and a score from
the countryside.</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” Pelleas said, “they must have
let us off at Arcady at last. I always knew I’d buy
a through ticket some day.”</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy came forward, twitching an amazing
shepherd’s cloak about him, and shook his shepherd’s
crook at us.</p>

<p>“I’m head goat,” he explained, “but they let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
call myself a goatherd because they think I won’t
see through the offence.”</p>

<p>Then Avis, laughing, drew Pelleas and me away
to tell us how at last her dream had come true
and that the white temple was the theater which
she had wanted for her guests at Little Rosemont,
and that on Monday it was to be opened
with some tableaux and an open-air play on the
grass-plot, under the moon. And when she had
shown us all the charms and wonders of the pretty
place she led us away for our drive across the fields
to the house.</p>

<p>As we emerged on the wide portico Pelleas stopped
us with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Look,” he said softly, “look there. Really, you
know, it’s like being somewhere else.”</p>

<p>Between the two central pillars we could see the
moon streaming full upon the tiled floor; and in the
brightness a little figure was standing, sandaled and
crowned and in white, a solitary portress of this
sylvan lodge. She had heard our approach and she
turned, a radiant little creature with bright hair
along her straight gown, and drew back and dropped
a quick, unmistakable courtesy!</p>

<p>I have seldom been more amazed than by the dipping
courtesy of that crowned head. Then I saw
to my further bewilderment that the salutation had
been intended for me. And as I looked at her a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
familiarity in her prettiness smote me, and I
knew her.</p>

<p>“It is Bonnie!” I said.</p>

<p>“O, ma’am,” said Bonnie, “yes’m,” and blushed
and waxed still prettier. And this was Bonnie, the
little maid whom I had last seen as I sat with Enid’s
baby under the pink crab apple-tree; and she
was come to Little Rosemont, Avis told me later,
because her mother lived there in charge of the
cedar linen room. (So her mother cannot have
been Demeter after all!) I remembered her
because of her really unusual prettiness which in
print gowns and white caps was hardly less notable
than in this splendour of white robe and
unbound hair. It was easy to see why Avis had
pressed her in service for the Monday tableaux.
It was easy to see that no one could be more
charmingly picturesque than Bonnie. And as I
looked down in her face upturned to answer some
slight thing that I was saying to her, in a flash
something else was clear to me. With Bonnie
here in this fair guise was it not the easiest matter
in the world to see who had been in the mind of
that fine young fellow up yonder there, with mandrake
in his hands?</p>

<p>It was a wild guess, if you like, but a guess not
difficult to make in that place of enchantment. I
protest that there are nights when one suspects one’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
very gateposts of observing each other kindly across
one’s gate.</p>

<p>“Bonnie,” said I, with an instant intention, “come
to my room to-night, please, and help me about my
unpacking. I’ve something to say to you.”</p>

<p>“O, yes’m,” said Bonnie, and I went away smiling
at the incongruity of having a radiant creature in a
diadem to brush my sad gray curls.</p>

<p>“I have put her in a tableau,” Avis said, in the
carriage, “in ‘The Return of Endymion.’ She is
a quaint little Diana. I have never seen such hair.”</p>

<p>On which, “Avis,” I asked serenely, “who, pray,
is that fine young fellow hereabout who is in love with
Bonnie?”</p>

<p>Avis, sitting tranquil in the white light with a
basket of rhinestones in her lap, looked flatteringly
startled.</p>

<p>“Half an hour on the place, Aunt Etarre,” she
said, shaking her head, “and you know our one
romance!”</p>

<p>“So does Pelleas,” I claimed defensively, “or, at
all events, he has actually talked with the lover.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Pelleas in that splendid disdain
which, in matters of romance, he always pretends,
“we were talking botany.”</p>

<p>“That’s he,” said Avis, nodding. “Bonnie’s
sweetheart is the young under-gardener—if you can
call a man a sweetheart who is as shy as Karl. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
is really Faint Heart. But I think those two little
people are in love.”</p>

<p>Then I learned how, ever since the coming of
Bonnie to Little Rosemont, this big young Karl had
paid her the most delicate and the most distant
attention. He had brought roots of violets and laid
them outside her window-ledge; and he had tossed
in her blind clusters of the first lady-slippers and
the first roses. But though all the household at
Little Rosemont had good-naturedly done what it
could to help on the affair, some way it had not
prospered. And as I listened I resolved past all
doubting that something must be done. For Pelleas
and I are fain to go through the world seeking
out people who love each other without knowing,
and saying to them: “Fair Heart and Faint Heart,
take each other’s hands and follow us.”</p>

<p>Still, I was obliged to be certain that Bonnie was
in love as well as the young god whom we had surprised,
and I meant to look in her eyes the while I
named the name of this young Karl. I think that
there are no eyes which I cannot read in a like circumstance
and the pastime is one of the delights of
my hours.</p>

<p>“Bonnie,” said I to the little maid as she brushed
my hair that night, “I’ve an idea that you were wishing
something delightful when you stood in that great
doorway to-night. Were you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“O, ma’am,” said little Bonnie, and I saw her
face, shadowy above my own in the mirror, burn
sudden crimson.</p>

<p>“Of course you were,” said I briskly. “Bonnie,”
I pursued, “when I came upon you I had just seen
under a birch-tree not far away a fine young fellow
with a flower in his hand. Can that have been the
under-gardener?”</p>

<p>“O, ma’am,” said Bonnie, “I s’pose, if he had a
flower—” and her voice trembled, and she did not
meet my eyes in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Bonnie!” said I.</p>

<p>Her eyes met mine.</p>

<p>“I know all about it,” said I boldly.</p>

<p>“O, ma’am,” she said, and tangled the comb in
my sad gray curls.</p>

<p>Whereupon I flattered myself that I had taken
Bonnie’s testimony and that I was fortified with a
thousand reasons for doing my best. But it was not
until the next day that I knew how, of all people, I
could count on Hobart Eddy to help me to be a kind
of servant of Fate.</p>

<p>I was in the library next morning when, every one
else being frightfully enthusiastic and gone to look
at the puppies, he came in and sat on an ottoman
at my feet—dear Hobart Eddy, with his tired
eyes and worldly-wise words and smile of utter
sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“Aunt Etarre,” he said, “I feel bored and miserable.
Let’s go out in the world, hand in hand, and
do a good deed. They say it sets you on your feet.
I’d like to try it.”</p>

<p>I shook my head, smiling. Nobody does more
charmingly generous things than Hobart and nobody,
I suppose, poses for such a man of self.</p>

<p>“No, Hobart,” I said, “good deeds are a self-indulgence
to you.”</p>

<p>“Everything I want to do they say will be a self-indulgence,”
he observed reflectively. “I dare say
when I die they’ll all say I let myself go at last.”</p>

<p>“What will they say when you fall in love?” I
asked idly.</p>

<p>“What have they said?” he parried.</p>

<p>“Everything,” I replied truthfully.</p>

<p>“Just so,” he answered; “you wouldn’t think
they would have so much ingenuity. The queer
thing,” he added meditatively, “is that such dull folk
have the originality to get up such good gossip.”</p>

<p>“But I mean,” I said, “when you really fall in
love.”</p>

<p>“I am in love,” he told me plaintively, “with
seeing other people in love. I would go miles merely
to look on two who are really devoted to each other.
I look about for them everywhere. Do you know,”
he said, “speaking of being in love myself, there is
a most exquisite creature in a tableau I’m in Monday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
night. I am in love with her, but, by Jove, it
being a tableau I can’t say a word to tell her so. It’s
my confounded luck. Sometimes I think I’m in a
tableau all the time and can’t say any of the things
I really mean.”</p>

<p>“And who may she be?” I asked politely, being
old to the meaningless enthusiasms of Hobart Eddy.</p>

<p>“By Jove! I didn’t find out,” he remembered.
“Nobody knew when I asked ’em. I suppose <i>they</i>
were in a tableau, too, and speechless. I forgot to
ask Avis. She’s a goddess, asleep on a bank. She’s
Diana—sandals and crown and all that. And I
believe I’m to come swooning down a cloud with a
gold club in my hand. Anyway—”</p>

<p>“Hobart Eddy,” I cried, “are you Endymion?”</p>

<p>“But why not?” he asked with a fine show of
indignation; “do you think I should be just an ordinary
shepherd, with no attention paid me?”</p>

<p>“Hobart Eddy, Hobart Eddy,” I said, “listen.”</p>

<p>Then I told him about Bonnie and Faint Heart,
young god of the gardens. And he heard me, smiling,
complaisant, delighted, and at the last, when he
had seen what I had in mind, properly enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“Bonnie is going to look beautiful Monday night,
Hobart,” I impressed him, “and that boy will not
be there to see her—save from far off, with mandrake
on his eyes! But he ought to be there to see
her—and Hobart, why can you not take him to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
wings with you for the tableaux and pretend that
you need him to help you? And after he has seen
Bonnie in her tableau you ought to be trusted to
arrange something pleasant—”</p>

<p>He listened, pretending to be wholly amused at
my excitement. But for all that he put in a word of
planning here and there that made me trust him—dear
Hobart Eddy.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he finally recalled plaintively, “but
I’m in love with her myself, you know, confound it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but think,” I comforted him, “how easily you
can forget your loves.”</p>

<p>The night of Monday came like a thing of cloud
that had been going before the day and had become
silver bright when the darkness overtook it. We
walked through the park from the house—Avis and
Lawrence and Pelleas and Hobart Eddy and I, across
the still fields never really waked from sleep by any
human voice. And when we came to the little temple
the moon was so bright that it was as if we had
passed into a kind of day made youthful, as we
dream our days.</p>

<p>Pelleas and I found our seats in one of the half-circle
of boxes built of sweet boughs, open to the
moon and walled by leaves. There was a vacant
chair or two and Avis and Lawrence and Hobart
Eddy sat with us in turn while the folk gathered—guests
from the near country-houses, guests who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
motored out from town, and the party from Little
Rosemont. The edge of the wood was hung with
lanterns, as if a shower of giant sparks were held in
the green.</p>

<p>“How will it be, Hobart?” I asked him eagerly
as he joined us.</p>

<p>“Be? The love story? O, he’s up there,” Hobart
assured me, “happy as anything. I think he’ll
put grease paint in Endymion’s eyes when he comes
to make me up, he’s that bereft.” He dropped his
voice. “He has a bunch of scarlet salvia the
size of a lamp,” he confided. “I think he means to
fire it at us in the blessed middle of the tableau.”</p>

<p>I am a sentimental old woman. For all through
that evening of beautiful pictures and beautiful
colour, I sat with my thought hovering about Bonnie
and that young Faint Heart. And yet I am not
ashamed of that. What better could my thought
hover round than such a joy, trembling into being?</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I whispered, “O, Pelleas. Look at
those people there, and there, and down there. They
don’t know what a charming secret is happening.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Pelleas, “they never do know.
Besides,” he added, “maybe they know one of their
own.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they do,” I thought, and looked with new
eyes on that watching half-circle, with moving fans
and fluttering scarfs. That is the best thing about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
an audience: the little happy secrets that are in the
hearts.</p>

<p>When “The Return of Endymion” was announced
I was in the pleasantest excitement. For I love
these hours when Love walks unmasked before me
and I am able to say: Such an one loves such an one
and O, I wish them well! The music sank to a
single strain that beckoned to the curtain of vines
behind the portico; the lights were lowered and a
ripple of expectation, or so I fancied, ran here and
there. And in the same instant I heard beside me
a familiar voice.</p>

<p>“Good setting for ’em, by Jove!” it said, and there
was Hobart Eddy, dropped down between Pelleas
and me.</p>

<p>“Hobart,” I said excitedly, “Hobart Eddy!
This is your tableau.”</p>

<p>He smiled, his familiar smile of utter sweetness,
and rested his chin on his hand and looked at the
stage.</p>

<p>“No, Aunt Etarre,” he said; “see.”</p>

<p>Before the portico the curtain of vines parted to
the tremble of the violins. There was the slope,
flower-spangled like the slope on which we sat and
across which, two nights ago, Pelleas and I had fancied
ourselves to be looking on immortal things.
And there on the flowers lay Diana asleep, her hair
spread on the green, the crescent glittering on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
forehead, her white robe sweeping her sandaled feet.
This was Bonnie, dear little maid, and it was her
hour; she would never again be so beautiful before
the whole world.</p>

<p>Even then I hardly understood until I saw him
come from the wings—Endymion, in the shepherd’s
cloak, with the shepherd’s crook in his hands. And
as he went near to her and stood looking down at her,
Bonnie opened her eyes and saw what I saw, that
her Endymion was that young god of an under-gardener.
Erect, splendid, crowned with oak
leaves—it was Karl’s hour, too, and he had
come to her. As the rose-light went stealing across
the picture, embracing the shadows, glowing in
her awakened face, he opened his arms to her and
caught her and held her to him. The light
burned vividly and beautifully; and, all her hair
rippling on his shepherd’s cloak, she clung to him,
before those people who sat and never guessed,
under the moon. It was their hour, the hour of
Bonnie and Karl, and Pelleas and I were really
looking toward a place of enchantment and on
immortal things.</p>

<p>The curtain of vines swept together in a soft
thunder of applause. Who were they, every one
was asking, but who were they, who had given to
the tableau a quality that was less like a picture than
like a dream?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
“Hobart, Hobart,” I said, trembling, “how did you
dare?”</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy was smiling at the ineffectual entreaties
of the audience for a repetition of the picture.
In vain they begged, the curtain of vines did not lift;
the music swelled to a note of finality and lights leaped
up.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t so faint-hearted,” said Hobart Eddy.
“To be sure, I was obliged to make him do it. But
then he did it. Faint Hearts aren’t like that.”</p>

<p>“Hobart,” said I raptly, “you are the fairy godmother,
after all.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” Hobart Eddy said dissentingly, “I only
did it because I wanted that minute when she opened
her eyes. I’d go miles to see two who are really devoted.
And I was in love with her myself, confound
it! But then,” he added philosophically, “if I’d
been there to take her in my arms I couldn’t have
looked on.”</p>

<p>In the intermission before the open-air play Pelleas
gave me a certain signal that we know and love
and he rose and slipped from our box of boughs.
I followed him without, and stepped with him across
the green to the edge of the wood. There we took
our way, as we had done on the night of our coming,
by the path in the trees, the path that was
just wide enough for, say, two violets when they
venture out to walk two by two in the safe night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
“I was afraid we might not be able to come here
again,” Pelleas explained, “and I thought we ought
...” he added vaguely. But I understood for I
had wanted to come no less than he.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said, as we stepped along the narrow
way, “suppose it had been as we fancied? Suppose
it had all been some enchanted place that would have
vanished with us?”</p>

<p>“Every time we fail to vanish from this world,”
Pelleas said reflectively, “something charming happens.
I suppose it is always so.”</p>

<p>“O, always,” I echoed confidently.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE GOLDEN WEDDING</p>

<p>Next day heaven opened to us—a heaven, as
does not always happen, of some one’s else making.
Our dear Avis Knight, fancying that Lawrence was
looking rather worn, persuaded him to shift the
world to other shoulders while he went off for
golden apples, and he agreed to a cruise in the
yacht. Whereupon, Avis begged that Pelleas and I
bring Nichola and spend at Little Rosemont the
month of their absence. The roses were in full
bloom and Avis said prettily that she longed to think
of us alone there among them. Really, to have inherited
North America would have been nothing
to this; for Little Rosemont is my idea of a palace
and I think is by far the most beautiful of the
Long Island country places.</p>

<p>Therefore Pelleas and I went in town to fetch
various belongings and Nichola. Or I think I
should say to approach Nichola, that violent and
inevitable force to be reckoned with like the weather
and earthquakes.</p>

<p>“Whatever will Nichola say?” we had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
wondering all the way on train and ferry, and “Whatever
<i>will</i> Nichola say?” we put it in a kind of panic,
as Pelleas turned the latch-key at our house.</p>

<p>We went at once to the kitchen and as we descended
the stairs we heard her singing low, like a lullaby,
that passionate serenade, <i>Com’ è gentil</i>, from Don
Pasquale. Her voice is harsh and broken and sadly
alien to serenades but the tones have never lost what
might have been their power of lullaby. Perhaps it
is that this is never lost from any woman’s voice.
At all events, old Nichola reduces street-organ song,
and hymn, and <i>aria di bravura</i> to this universal cradle
measure.</p>

<p>When we appeared thus suddenly before her she
looked up, but she did not cease her song. She kept
her eyes on us and I saw them light, but the serenade
went on and her hands continued their task above
the table.</p>

<p>“Nichola,” I said, “we are invited to a most
beautiful place on Long Island to stay a month
while our friends are away. We are to take you, and
we must start to-morrow. The house has one hundred
and forty rooms, Nichola, and you shall be my
lady’s maid, as you used.”</p>

<p>“And nothing to do, Nichola, but pick roses and
sing,” Pelleas added, beaming.</p>

<p>Our old serving-woman pinched the crust about a
plump new pie. On the board lay a straggling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
remnant of the dough for the Guinea goat. Nichola
always fashioned from the remnant of pie-crust a
Guinea goat which she baked and, with a blanket
of jelly, ate, beginning at the horns. Once in her
native Capri there had appeared, she had told me,
a man from West Africa leading a Guinea goat
which she averred could count; and the incident
had so impressed her that she had never since made
a pie without shaping this ruminant quadruped.
Whether there really ever was such a goat I do not
know, but Nichola believed in it and in memoriam
molded pie-crust goats by the thousand. She has
even fried them as doughnuts, too; but these are not
so successful for the horns puff out absurdly.</p>

<p>“A hundred and forty rooms, Nichola,” I said,
“and you shall be my lady’s maid.”</p>

<p>“Yah!” Nichola rejoined, interrupting her song
rather to attend to pricking the pie-crust with a fork
than to reply to us; “don’t look for no lady-maiding
from me, mem. I’ll be kep’ busy countin’ up the
windows, me. When do we start off?” she wanted
to know.</p>

<p>Nichola evidently believed us to be jesting. Later
when she found that our extravagant proposition
was the truth she pretended to have known from the
first.</p>

<p>We were in the midst of our simple preparations,
when a wonderful thing occurred to Pelleas. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
folding my gown of heliotrope silk in its tissues, the
gown with the collar of Mechlin which is now my
chief finery, when Pelleas came in our room.</p>

<p>“Etarre,” he said, “you know what day comes
next week. And now we shall spend it at Little
Rosemont, alone!”</p>

<p>I knew what he meant. Had we not previously
talked of it and mourned that it was not possible to
us to celebrate that day alone, as we had always
dreamed that one’s golden-wedding day should be
spent?</p>

<p>“Our wedding day—our golden-wedding day,” I
said.</p>

<p>Pelleas nodded. “As if they have not all been
golden,” he observed simply.</p>

<p>There was in every fern a nod for our good fortune
as on that next afternoon Pelleas and Nichola and I
drove up the avenue at Little Rosemont. And at the
very park entrance, though of course we did not know
that at the time, a part of our adventure began when
the gate was opened by that brown, smiling young
under-gardener Karl, with honest man’s eyes and a
boy’s dimples, who bowed us into the place like a
good genie. As we returned his greeting we felt that
he was in a manner ringing up the curtain on the
spectacle but we did not forecast that he was also
to play a most important part.</p>

<p>In the great hall all the servants were gathered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
welcome us, an ensemble of liveries and courtesies in
which I distinguished only Mrs. Woods, the housekeeper,
very grave, a little hoarse, and clothed on with
black satin. We escaped as soon as possible, Pelleas
and I not having been formed by heaven to play the
important squire and his lady arriving home to bonfires
and village bells and a chorus of our rent roll.
But once safely in the lordly sitting room of our suite,
with its canopies and a dais, and epergnes filled with
orchids, I had but to look at Pelleas to feel wonderfully
at home. It is a blessed thing to love some one
so much that you feel at home together in any place
of deserts or perils or even lordly rooms filled with
orchids.</p>

<p>On that first evening we were destined to chance
upon another blessed thing of the same quality.
After our solitary dinner in the stately dining-room,
Pelleas and I went wandering in the grounds, very
still in the hush of June with June’s little moon
lying on the sky. Little Rosemont is a place of
well-swept lawns, and orchards then newly freed from
the spell of their bloom; it is a place of great spaces
and long naves, with groves whose trees seem to
have been drawn together to some secret lyre. The
house is a miracle of line and from its deep verandas
one sees afar off a band of the sea, as if some god
had struck it from the gray east. And everywhere at
that glad season were the roses, thousands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
thousands of roses—ah, fancy using figures to
compute roses quite as one does in defraying debts.
Though indeed as Pelleas frivolously said, “‘Time
brings roses’ but so does money!” For many of
those assembled were from Persia and Cashmere and
I dare say from Lud and Phut. I think that I have
never had an experience of great delight at which a
band of familiar, singing things was not present;
and when I remember the month at Little Rosemont
it is as if the roses were the musical interludes,
like a Greek chorus, explaining what is. They
hang starry on almost every incident; unless
perhaps on that of the night of our arrival, when
we are told that Nichola in the servants’ dining-hall
produced a basket which she had brought with her
and calmly took therefrom her Guinea goat of the
day before and ate it, before all assembled, beginning
at the horns!</p>

<p>From the driveway on that first walk Pelleas and I
looked up to a balcony over which the roses were at
carnival. It was the kind of balcony that belongs
to a moon and I half suspect all such balconies to be
moon-made and invisible by sun or starlight; it was
the kind of balcony that one finds in very old books,
and one is certain that if any other than a lover were
to step thereon it would forthwith crumble away.
Pelleas, looking up at the balcony, irrelevantly said:—</p>

<p>“Do you remember the young rector over there in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
Inglese? The Reverend Arthur Didbin? Who
married Viola to Our Telephone the other day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, Pelleas,” said I, listening. What
could the Reverend Arthur Didbin have to do with
this balcony of roses?</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking,” Pelleas went on, “that next
week, on our golden-wedding day you know, we might
have him come up here in the evening—there will
be a full moon then—” he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes?” I pressed him, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Well, and we might have him read the service
for us, just we three up there on the balcony. The
marriage service, Etarre—unless you think it would
be too stupid and sentimental, you know?”</p>

<p>“Stupid!” I said, “O, Pelleas.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, Nichola would think we were mad,” he
defended his scruples.</p>

<p>“But she thinks so anyway,” I urged, “and besides
she will never know. But Mr. Didbin—what of
him?” I asked doubtfully; “will he laugh or will he
understand?”</p>

<p>Pelleas reflected.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” he said, “Hobart told me that one
night when Mr. Didbin’s train ran into an open switch
he walked through six miles of mud to marry a
little country couple whom he had never seen.”</p>

<p>And that confirmed us: The Reverend Arthur Didbin
would understand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
We stepped on in the pleasant light talking of this
quite as if we had a claim on moon-made balconies
and were the only lovers in the world. That we
were not the only lovers we were soon to discover.
At the edge of a grove, where a midsummer-night-dream
of a fountain tinkled, we emerged on a green
slope spangled with little flowers; and on its marge
stood a shallow arbour formed like a shell or a petal
and brave with bloom. We hastened toward it,
certain that it had risen from the green to receive us,
and were close upon it before we saw that it was
already occupied. And there sat Bonnie, the little
maid whose romance we had openly fostered, and
with her that young Karl, the under-gardener, whom
we observed in an instant Avis could never call
Faint Heart any more.</p>

<p>Pelleas glanced at me merrily as we immediately
turned aside pretending to be vastly absorbed in
some botanical researches on the spangled evening
slope.</p>

<p>“Bless us, Etarre,” he said, smiling, “what a world
it is. You cannot possibly hollow out an arbour
anywhere without two lovers waiting to occupy it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” said I, “the only difficulty is that there
are more lovers than arbours. Here are we for example,
arbourless.”</p>

<p>But that we did not mind. On the contrary, being
meddlers where arbours and so on are concerned, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
set about finding out more of the two whom we had
surprised. This was not difficult because we had
brought with us Nichola; and through her we were
destined to develop huge interest in the household.
Nichola indeed talked of them all perpetually while
she was about my small mending and dressing and
she scolded shrilly at matters as she found them quite
as she habitually criticizes all orders and systems.
Nichola is in conversation a sad misanthrope, which
is a pity, for she does not know it; and to know it is,
one must suppose, the only compensation for being a
misanthrope. She inveighed for example against the
cook and the head laundress who had a most frightful
feud of long standing, jealously nourished, though
neither now had the faintest idea in what it had arisen—was
this not cosmopolitan and almost human of
these two? And Nichola railed at the clannishness
of the haughty Scotch butler until he one day opened
an entry door for her, after which she softened her
carping, as is the way of the world also, and objected
only to what she called his “animal brogue,”
for all the speeches of earth alien to the Italian are
to Nichola a sign of just so much black inferiority.
And she went on at a furious rate about the scandalous
ways of “Reddie,” the second stableman, who, she
declared, “kep’ the actual rats in the stable floor
with their heads off their pillows, what with his
playin’ on a borrow’ fiddle that he’d wen’ to work an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
learnt of himself.” Through Nichola we also had
our attention directed to Mrs. Woods’ groveling fear
of burglars—her one claim to distinction unless one
includes that she pronounced them “burgulars.”
And too we heard of the sinful pride of Sarah McLean
of the cedar linen room who declared in the hearing
of the household that one of her ancestors was a
<i>Hittite</i>. Where she had acquired this historic impression
we never learned nor with what she had
confused the truth; but she stoutly clung to her
original assertion and on one occasion openly told
the housekeeper that as for her family-tree it was in
the Old Testament Bible; and the housekeeper,
crossing herself, told this to Nichola who listened,
making the sign of the horn to ward away the evil.
It was like learning the secrets of a village; but the
greatest of these realities proved to be Bonnie
McLean, daughter of her of Hittite descent, and
Karl, the under-gardener and the genie of the
gate. Picture the agitation of Pelleas and me when
Nichola told us this:—</p>

<p>“Yes, mem,” she said, “them two, they’re in love
<i>pitiful</i>. But the young leddy’s mother, she’s a widdy-leddy
an’ dependent on. An’ as for the young
fellow, he’s savin’ up fer to get his own mother acrost
from the old country an’ when he does it they’re
agoin’ to get marrit. But he needs eighty dollars
an’ so far they say he’s got nine. Ain’t it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
shame, mem, an’ the very potatoes in this house with
cluster diamin’s in their eyes?”</p>

<p>Surely Avis did not know this about the young
lovers—Avis, one of whose frocks would have set
the two at housekeeping with the mother from “the
old country” at the head of the table. Pelleas and
I were certain that she did not know, although we
have found that there are charming people of colossal
interests to whom one marriage more or less seems
to count for as little as a homeless kitten, or a “fledgling
dead,” or the needless felling of an ancient oak.
But it is among these things that Pelleas and I live,
and we believe that in spite of all the lovers in the
world there is yet not enough love to spare one lover’s
happiness. So while the moon swelled to the full
and swung through the black gulf of each night as
if it had been shaped by heaven for that night’s appointment,
we moved among the roses of Little Rosemont,
biding our golden-wedding day, gradually becoming
more and more intent upon the romance and
the homely realities of that liveried household.
Perhaps it was the story of Bonnie and Karl that
suggested to Pelleas the next step in our adventure;
or it may have been our interest in “Reddie,” whom
we unearthed in the stable one afternoon and who,
radiant, played for us for an hour and fervently
thanked us when he had concluded. At all events,
as our day of days came on apace Pelleas became convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
that it was infamously selfish for us to spend
it in our own way. Because heaven had opened
to us was that a reason for occupying heaven to the
exclusion of the joys of others?</p>

<p>“Etarre,” he said boldly, “there is not the least
virtue in making those about one happy. That is
mere civilization. But there is nobody about us but
Avis’ servants. And she told us to make ourselves
at home. Let’s give all the servants a holiday on
that day and get on by ourselves.”</p>

<p>“We might let them picnic in the grounds,” I
suggested doubtfully.</p>

<p>“With lemonade and cake,” Pelleas submitted.</p>

<p>“Lemonade and cake!” I retorted with superiority;
“the servants of to-day expect lobster and champagne.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” Pelleas defiantly maintained, “I believe
they will like your cream tarts anyway.” He
meditated for a moment and then burst out daringly:
“Etarre! Would Avis care? Of course she
could never do it herself; but do you think she
would care if we let them all come up that night and
dance in the great hall?”</p>

<p>I stared at Pelleas aghast.</p>

<p>“But they wouldn’t like it, Pelleas!” I cried;
“servants, in this day, are different. That butler
now—O, Pelleas, he’d never do it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he would,” Pelleas returned confidently;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
“he’s a fine Scot with a very decent bagpipe in his
clothes closet. I’ve seen it. I’ll get him to bring
it!” Pelleas declared with assurance.</p>

<p>“But why—” I quavered momentarily; “and
why not?” I instantly went on; “the very thing!”
I ended, as triumphantly as if I had thought the matter
out quite for myself. “And, if you like, Pelleas,
I’ll oversee the making of the cream tarts for the
whole company!” I added, not to be outdone.</p>

<p>It is amazing what pleasant incredulities become
perfectly possible when once you attack them as
Nichola attacks her Guinea goats, beginning at the
horns.</p>

<p>So that was why, having broached the subject to
those concerned as delicately as if we had been providing
entertainment for a minister of state; having
been met with the enthusiasm which such a minister
might exhibit as diplomacy; and having myself
contributed to the event by the preparation of a
mountain of my <i>chef d’œuvre</i>, the frozen cream tarts
which Pelleas appears to think would be fitting for
both thrones and ministers assembled, he and I
stood together at half after eight on the evening of
our golden-wedding day and, in the middle of our
lordly sitting room, looked at each other with tardy
trembling. Now that the occasion was full upon
us it seemed a Titanic undertaking. I was certain
that far from being delighted the servants were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
alarmed and derisive and wary of our advances;
that “Reddie” would at the last moment refuse to
play upon his borrowed fiddle for the dancing; and
that the haughty Scotch butler would be bored to
extinction.</p>

<p>“O, Pelleas!” I said miserably, as we went down
the grand staircase, “it’s a terrible business, this
attempt at philanthropy among the servants in high
places.”</p>

<p>“At all events,” said Pelleas brightly, “we are not
plotting to improve them. Though of course if that
is done in the right way—” he added, not to be
thought light-minded. Pelleas has an adorable
habit of saying the most rebellious things, but it is
simply because he is of opinion that a great deal
of nonsense is talked by those who have not the brains
to rebel.</p>

<p>On a sudden impulse he drew me aside to the
latticed window of the landing and pushed it ajar.
The moon rode high above the oaks; it was as if the
night stood aside in delighted silence in this exalted
moment of the moon’s full. Around the casement
the roses gathered, so that the air was sweet.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” Pelleas said softly, “I dare say they’ll
like it. They must—‘in such a night.’ We’ll
leave them to themselves in a little while. The
Reverend Arthur Didbin will be here at ten, remember.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>The great honey-tongued clock beside us touched
the silence with the half hour.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I whispered him, “O, Pelleas. It was
fifty years ago this very minute. We were saying,
‘I will’ and ‘I will.’”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pelleas, “we have, dear. Though
we may yet fall out on a question of Angora cats and
the proper way to lay an open fire.”</p>

<p>We smiled, but we understood. And we lingered
for a moment in silence. Let me say to all
skeptics that it is worth being married an hundred
years to attain such a moment as that.</p>

<p>Then as we went down the stairs the dining-room
door suddenly burst open with an amazing, eerie
clamour; and into the great oak-paneled hall
marched the haughty Scotch butler in full Highland
costume, plaid and bare knees and feather, playing
on his bagpipe like mad. No peril, then, of his
being bored to extinction, nor the others, as we
were soon to find. For the bagpipe gave the signal
and immediately came pouring from below stairs the
great procession of our guests. My old head grows
quite giddy as I try to recount them. There were
Mrs. Woods, very grave, a little hoarse, and clothed
on with black satin; and the mother of Bonnie in
brown silk and a cameo pin, as became a daughter
of the Hittites; and Bonnie herself of exquisite prettiness
in white muslin and rosebuds; and Karl in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
well-brushed black; and “Reddie,” his face shining
above a flaming cravat; and the cook and the head
laundress who had entered competitive toilettes like
any gentlewomen; and the other menservants in
decent apparel; and a bevy of <i>chic</i> maids in crisp
finery and very high heels. Led by Mrs. Woods
they came streaming toward us and shook our hands—was
ever such a picture anywhere, I wondered, as I
saw them moving between the priceless tapestries and
clustering about the vast marble fireplace that came
from the quarries of Africa. And to our unbounded
gratification they seemed immensely to like it all
and not to have lost their respect for us because we
were civil to them. Then when, presently, we had
sent “Reddie” and his fiddle up to the pillared musicians’
gallery, they all rose to his first strains and
in an instant the Scotch butler had led out the crispest
and highest-heeled of the maids and they all danced
away with a will. Danced very well too. It is
amazing how tricks of deportment are communicable
from class to class. If I were to offer to solve the
servant problem I conclude that I would suggest to
all employers: Be gentlemen and gentlewomen
yourselves and live with all dignity and daintiness.
Though I dare say that I am a very impractical old
woman, but all the virtue in the world does not lie
in practicality either.</p>

<p>In a little time Pelleas slipped away to brew a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
steaming punch—a harmless steaming punch made
from a recipe which my mother, who was a high
church woman, always compounded for dining archbishops
and the like. Bonnie and Karl did not dance
but sat upon an old stone window seat brought from
Thebes and watched with happy eyes. And when
the punch came in we wheeled it before them and
they served every one.</p>

<p>In that lull in the dancing I looked about with
sudden misgiving; Nichola was not with us. Where
was Nichola, that faithful old woman, and why was
she not at our party? She had left me in full season
to make ready.</p>

<p>“Where is Nichola?” I anxiously demanded of
Pelleas, reproaching myself for my neglect.</p>

<p>Pelleas did not immediately answer and when I
looked up I fancied that I detected his eyes twinkling.
But before I could wonder or inquire came that
which it makes my heart beat now to remember.
Without the slightest warning there sounded and
echoed a violent summons on the great entrance
doors. Nothing could have created more consternation
than did the innocent fall of that silver knocker
at Little Rosemont.</p>

<p>I chanced to be sitting near the door and I think
that I must have risen in astonishment. I saw
Pelleas whirl in concern, and I was conscious
of the instant lull in the animated talk. Then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
Scotch butler recovered himself and in full Highland
costume, with bare knees, he sprang to his post
quite as if this had been at the head of a mountain
pass and threw wide the door.</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” I heard exclaiming a fine,
magnetic voice, “upon my word, a party. Let us
blush and withdraw.”</p>

<p>But they came crowding to the door; and there in
motor caps and coats stood a gay company of our
friends and the friends of Avis, and of them
Madame Sally Chartres and Wilfred; and Lisa and
her uncle, Dudley Manners, who were guests near by
at Chynmere Hall; and Hobart Eddy, whose was
the voice that I had heard. They had motored out
from town and from places roundabout us and were
come to pay us a visit.</p>

<p>“Sally!” said I feebly. Sally was with Hobart
Eddy who adores her and, his critics say, affects her
so-picturesque company to add to his so-popular
eccentricities. And with them came a cloud of the
mighty, a most impressive cloud of witnessing railway
presidents and bankers and statesmen and the
like; and all spectators at our party.</p>

<p>“Ah, Etarre!” Sally cried blithely, “this is
charming. But—we are not invited.”</p>

<p>“No one is invited,” said I faintly, “we all belong
here. Ah,” I cried, as the humour of it overcame me,
“come in. Do come in. The punch is just served.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>They needed no second bidding. In they all
marched in the merriest of humours, not in the least
understanding the meaning of that strange assembly
but with sufficient of moon magic and the swift
motion in their dancing blood to be ready for everything.
And while Pelleas led them away to the billiard
room to put aside their wraps, I found Hobart
Eddy beside me. And somehow, before I knew, I
was telling him all about the occasion and at his
beseeching actually leading him from one to another
and soberly presenting him to Mrs. Woods and the
daughter of the Hittites and the cook. Only to see
that elegant young leader of cotillons bowing before
the head laundress in her competitive toilette was
something to remember.</p>

<p>“And <i>voilà mes enfants</i>, the sweethearts,” he murmured
as we halted near the window seat from Thebes.
There sat Bonnie and Karl, intent upon each other,
she with a flush on her face that matched the rosebuds
of her frock. And how it happened I hardly
know, save that I was at that moment a distracted
old woman and that in matters of romance I invariably
lose my head; but I instantly went a little mad
and told Hobart Eddy all about that young Endymion
and his Diana of the tableaux: how Endymion’s old
mother must be spirited from “the old country” before
they might be married; and even how eighty dollars
was necessary and how they had only nine. I had just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
paused breathless when the others came trooping
from the den, and Sally Chartres in white cloth and
white curls leaned upon the arm of Mr. Dudley
Manners—he is king of some vast part of the
mineral or vegetable kingdom at the moment though
they modestly call it only a corner—and insisted
on meeting every one, on hearing the bagpipe,
on listening to “Reddie” play, and on being a good
angel with a cloud of the mighty at her side.</p>

<p>In the midst of this bewildering business the dining-room
doors opened and in came the tall and smiling
footmen whose part was to bring up the supper
of cold dainties. And even in that moment my
heart thrilled with thanksgiving and pride in the
contemplation of the one tall footman who bore
the tray of those cream tarts of mine. I say it
boldly, and Pelleas said it first: there never
was such a decoction of thick, frozen cream and
foamy chocolate in this world of delectables. I
could not veil my satisfaction as I saw these set upon
the table where the plates were piled, and of a truth
they looked so delicious that for an instant it seemed
to me the most natural thing in the world that Hobart
Eddy should leap from his place at my side as
if he had gone suddenly mad at the sight.</p>

<p>“Wait, please!” he cried ringingly, “no one must
touch anything yet!”</p>

<p>On which he sprang up the step that leads to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
great yellow salon, lighted to enhance the look of
festivity, and thus stood directly back of the supper
table. He was very handsome, his face alight
and glowing, his erect, compact figure drawn to its
full height. And before I could even guess what he
was about, what had he done, this idol of society,
this deviser of the eccentric, but make his friends
know in a burst of amazing eloquence all that I
had just told him of the love story of Bonnie and
Karl, save their very names.</p>

<p>His friends listened, curious, ready to be amused,
and at the last genuinely diverted; and the household
of Little Rosemont listened, bewildered, not
knowing what to expect; and as for Bonnie and Karl
and Pelleas and me, we four listened and doubted
the evidence of our own senses, until:—</p>

<p>“Therefore,” cried Hobart Eddy, “I offer at
auction a portion of the contents of this table, especially
one fourth of this tray of amazing tarts,
as an all-star benefit for these two young people.
Also, I offer a limited number of glasses of yonder
punch—hey, Mannie!” he called warningly to Mr.
Dudley Manners, who stood with a punch glass in
his hand; “drop it down, man!”</p>

<p>“I’m hanged if I do,” said Mr. Manners,
merrily; “I’ll bid five for it first, you know!”</p>

<p>“Done!” cried Hobart Eddy, rapping on the
table, “and what am I bid for this first appetizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
and innocent confection, this tart, all compact of
cream and spices—” So he went on, and I clung to
my chair and expected the whole place to crumble
away and Nichola to call me to breakfast in New
York. It was too wonderful.</p>

<p>But it was all true. They were caught in the
spirit of the happy hour as if this had been some
new game contrived to tempt their flagging interests.
They gathered about the table, they bid
one another down, they prompted the auctioneer,
they escaped to corners with cream tarts—my
cream tarts!—for which they had paid a price that
made me tremble. And as for our original guests,
they were lined up at a respectful distance, but quite
frantic with the excitement, for they were all devoted—as
who would not have been?—to the two to
whom this would mean all happiness. And as for
Bonnie and Karl, scarce able to breathe they sat on
the stone bench from Thebes and clung to each other’s
hands. Ah, there never was such an hour. It
makes me young to think of it.</p>

<p>So it went on until the last tart of the portion which
he had reserved was auctioned to the highest bidder.
And hardly had Hobart Eddy invited the others to
the table and paused for breath when the question
that had been forced from my mind by the unexpected
arrivals was answered: Nichola appeared in
the dining-room door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>She had made herself splendid in her best frock,
a flaming scarlet merino; for Nichola has never lost
her Italian love of colour. On her head she had a
marvelous cap of the kind that she can fashion at
a moment’s notice from a linen pillow case and a bit
of string. And she too bore a tray, a tray of that
which had detained her below stairs fashioning it
for a surprise, a tray, in short, heaped with tiers
and tiers of pie-crust Guinea goats.</p>

<p>On these Hobart Eddy seized with an ardour
that was beautiful to see. Nichola, frowning terribly,
stood back half minded to break into shrill
upbraidings. And while I was trying between my
tears and smiles to make her know what it was all
about, her whole herd of goats was sold off at a price
which she afterward told me, privately, was as high
as the Pope in the Vatican could expect for his pie
crusts.</p>

<p>They swept the pile of crisp notes and shining coin
into a hat and thrust it in the hands of Nichola, who
stood nearest; and that old woman at their bidding
crossed the slippery oaken floor and poured the
treasure in the lap of little Bonnie, while the daughter
of the Hittites sobbed on the first shoulder, which
chanced to be that of her ancient enemy, the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Nichola’s presentation speech was brief and to the
point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>“Here,” she said, “get marrit.”</p>

<p>Bonnie, dear little maid in muslin and rosebuds,
stood up with Karl, both pink and white to see; and
they bowed, and laughed through their tears. Ah,
there were tears in the eyes of others of us too as we
looked; and Madame Sally Chartres and a very
gay and magnificent Mrs. Dane-Orvil and the cook
formed one group and impartially smiled at one
another. Some way, a mask had fallen.</p>

<p>With Nichola’s words still in our ears the clock
chimed quarter after ten, and in the moonlight of
the open door appeared on a sudden the eager,
concerned face of the Reverend Arthur Didbin, come
to keep his appointment with Pelleas and me.</p>

<p>At sight of him Pelleas fairly beamed.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he cried out; “what do these two
young people say? Why shall they not be married
<i>now</i>?”</p>

<p>Why not, indeed? The proposition was met with
acclamation. They hardly waited for the frightened,
ecstatic nod of star-eyed little Bonnie before
they had the supper table pushed aside—indeed,
I do not remember now whether it was the railway
president and Mr. Dudley Manners who did most of
the work or the Scotch butler and the footmen, for
they all helped together. And Bonnie and Karl
stood up in the door of the salon, and so did the
daughter of the Hittites, and Hobart Eddy insisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
on being joint best man with the Scotch butler,
and the Reverend Arthur Didbin married the two
young lovers then and there. I have always held
that the license demanded in some parts is unromantic
nonsense.</p>

<p>After that there was a blur of adieux, and
Hobart Eddy kissed my hand and even when his
machine had been started came running back in the
moonlight to get from Karl the address of his mother
“in the old country” so that he might cable to her
and have her rejoicing by next morning. No,
never tell me that any man is mere idler and dilettante,
for I have seen the heart of one such and hereafter
I dare not disbelieve in any one.</p>

<p>They all swept down the moonlit drive, hands
waving, motor horns sounding; and the haughty
Scotch butler in full Highland costume stood between
two pillars and played his bagpipe to speed them on
their way. The door of the tonneau of the last
motor had just been hospitably opened with the
offer to set down the Reverend Arthur Didbin in the
village when that gentleman, his gray hair blowing,
hurried to where Pelleas and I were standing.</p>

<p>“But,” he said anxiously, “did you not wish me
for something? Did you not wish—”</p>

<p>At that Pelleas and I looked away from each other
in sudden consternation and then with one accord
smiled and shook our heads. With our assurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
he turned away and in silence we watched him down
the drive. And after the last motor had disappeared
behind the shrubbery Pelleas and I lingered alone
in the moonlit portal breathing in the roses, and
still we did not meet each other’s eyes. But when
there was at last no excuse for our waiting there
longer I looked up at him shamefacedly enough.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I faced the truth, but solemnly lest he
should imagine that I was not filled with regret at
our neglect, “Pelleas, we <i>forgot</i> our golden wedding.”</p>

<p>“But there has been a golden wedding all the
same,” said Pelleas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>However, in fear of what the balcony of roses
would think of our defection, we stepped out there
for a moment on our way upstairs. And there Pelleas
said over something that is a kind of bridal
song for a Golden Wedding:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My own, confirm me! If I tread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This path back, is it not in pride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To think how little I dreamed it led</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To an age so blessed that by its side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Youth seems the waste instead!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We do not think that the balcony itself can have
agreed with this, because it was a moon balcony,
made for youthful lovers. But roses are like a
chorus, explaining what is; and no one can persuade
us that these failed to understand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XV">XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE WEDDING</p>

<p>Toward the end of July we found that the lodge
at Little Rosemont was to be vacant for a month or
two and Pelleas rented it, furnished, from the agent;
and we took Nichola and moved down the length of
the gravel to the littlest house in the world, set in
the littlest garden. There we were established three
days and more before Avis and Lawrence were expected
home.</p>

<p>We had merely crossed the garden from the great
house, and yet life in the little house seemed another
matter, as if a harp were heard in a room instead of
in an open field. We felt less professionally alive
and more free to live. It was as if, Pelleas said,
we were reading a poem rather for the exquisite
meaning than for the exquisite rhythm.</p>

<p>There was another reason why the lodge invited us.
Though it was nearly August, its tiny garden, walled
round with a half-moon of hedge, was rich with
roses as if, Pelleas said, for an after-meeting of
certain Junes. For the lodge garden had been set
with monthly roses, those prodigals of giving, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
there Chinese roses, Bengal roses, Giant of Battles
and Cloth of Gold rioted about a Hundred-leaved
rose from the Caucasus and that week they were all
ripe with bloom.</p>

<p>That first morning as we stepped on the porch was
a kind of greeting, as intimate and personal as a nod.
Pelleas and I stood in the garden with the sun, as I
believe, slanting madly in every direction and butterflies
vanishing against the blue. At all events, that
is as I soberly recall the day; and yet it is the day
which we remember as our one offence against love.
It was the one time in our life that we said of two
lovers in whom we believed: “Are we sure that
they are right?” instead of our usual: “Let them
be married to-day!” I can hardly credit my own
feint at heartlessness.</p>

<p>We went across the strip of terrace with a pleasure
that was like the pleasure of beginnings. In the center
of the garden was a little pool for water flowers
and there we set the fountain free in the sheer delight
of bringing about all the liberty possible; and
we watched the scarlet tanagers bathing in the
trickling outlet beside the Hundred-leaved rose.
And so we came at last to the arbour in a green
corner of the wall, and in its doorway we stood still
with the reasonable impression that we were thinking
what we seemed to see.</p>

<p>On a bench beneath a window where the roses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
made an oval open to the garden sat a girl. At first,
save the shining of her hair, I saw only that she had
beside her a little traveling bag and, also beside her, a
fine, manly boy of not a day more than twenty-two.
She was crying a little and he was attempting with
adorable awkwardness to comfort her. At first
glance the most rational explanation was that they
were run-away sprites from some neighbouring goblin
settlement, and Pelleas and I were making a
sympathetic effort to withdraw when they looked
up and saw us.</p>

<p>Lo, with a little traveling bag between them, there
were Lisa and Eric.</p>

<p>Almost before I grasped the import of this I hurried
forward and took Lisa in my arms. In all
possible affairs I firmly believe that the kiss should
come first and the explanation afterward.</p>

<p>“But it is Lisa!” I cried. “Pelleas, it is Lisa
and Eric. Wherever have you come from, dear
heart?”</p>

<p>The story was out in one burst of courage with the
tears so near, so near.</p>

<p>“I came from Chynmere,” she said; “Uncle
Dudley and I are still at the Wortleys’, you know—that
is, Uncle Dudley is there. I—I ran away
from the Hall this m-morning. I—I eloped. I—Eric—we
are going to be—”</p>

<p>Of course the rest was luminously clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>“Dear heart,” I cried, “then what in this world
are you crying for?”</p>

<p>Crying. In the midst of one’s elopement on a
glad morning with the sun slanting in every direction
and butterflies vanishing against the blue.</p>

<p>“At all events,” said young Eric Chartres, with
the most charmingly abashed smile, “<i>I’m</i> not crying.”</p>

<p>Bit by bit this logical climax of the Summer’s
situation was imparted to us—indeed, Pelleas
and I had already secretly prophesied it. For Dudley
Manners to have charge of little Lisa at all was
sufficiently absurd; but for him with his middle-aged
worldliness to have in keeping her love story
was not to be borne. Lisa and Eric had been
betrothed since Spring and in those two months
Dudley Manners’ objection on the score of their
youth had not been to any extent outgrown. Moreover,
Lisa explained tremulously, Uncle Dudley
had lately given out that she had not yet “seen the
world.” Therefore he had taken passage for her
and a Miss Constance Wortley, a governess cousin
at Chynmere Hall—elderly and an authority on
plant life in Alaska—and they were to go abroad
to see the world for two years; and Eric was of course
to be left behind.</p>

<p>“<i>Two years</i>,” Lisa said impressively, with the
usual accent of two eternities; “we were to go to the
north of Africa to watch the musk roses bloom and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
to the Mediterranean to look for rosemary. Uncle
Dudley thinks <i>that</i> would be seeing the world. So
Eric came this morning early and I slipped down and
met him before any one was up. And we came
here. I told Eric,” Lisa confessed, “what you told
me about Cornelia Emmeline Ayres’ elopement.
And we <i>knew</i> you would both understand.”</p>

<p>Pelleas and I looked at each other swiftly. Nature
is very just.</p>

<p>“But what are you crying for, dear?” I puzzled
then; “you are never sorry you came?”</p>

<p>“Ah, but,” said Lisa sadly, “I think that Miss
Wortley really wants to go to Europe and wait about
for things to bloom. And now of course she can’t.
And then they say—Uncle Dudley says—that I can’t
make Eric happy until I know something of life.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said I from the superiority of my
seventy years, “I don’t know about the rest. But
that much I am positive is nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t loving somebody knowing all about life?”
Lisa asked simply.</p>

<p>“It is,” Pelleas and I answered together.</p>

<p>“Ah,” Lisa cried, brightening, “I <i>said</i> you would
understand. Didn’t I, Eric?”</p>

<p>Eric raptly assented. I had always liked the boy.
His whole mind was on Lisa and yet, though from
the edges of his consciousness, he had an exquisite
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“At all events,” said I when presently I left Lisa
in the flowered chintz guest room, “let us lunch
first and be married afterward. Whatever happens
you must have one of Nichola’s salads.”</p>

<p>I hurried downstairs longing to find Pelleas and
to plan with him how we were to bring it all about;
but Pelleas was still in conference with that young
lover and they were walking up and down the path,
heads bent, brows grave, as if the matter were actually
one requiring the weightiest consideration. I
stood for a moment at the hall window to watch them,
with all my heart longing to cry out: Never mind
the reasons. Look at the roses. It is perfectly
easy to see what <i>they</i> think.</p>

<p>Instead I went to the kitchen to say a word about
luncheon. And the day was so sunny and the guests
at luncheon were so to my liking and my heart was
so full of their story that, as well as for a more practical
reason, I was obliged to tell something of it to
Nichola.</p>

<p>Nichola was washing green leaves, and these,
tender and curled in her withered hands, were as
incongruous as a flush I had once detected on her
withered cheek. In her starched print gown Nichola
looked that morning like some one cut from stiff
paper.</p>

<p>“Nichola,” said I, “I <i>think</i> we may have a wedding
here this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>Instantly her little deep-set eyes became quick-lidded
with disapproval.</p>

<p>“It is by no means certain,” I pursued, “but we
hope to have it here. And,” I advanced delicately,
“could you possibly have ready for us something
frozen and delicious, Nichola? With little cakes?
Then you need make no dessert at all for dinner.”</p>

<p>Nichola looked at me doubtfully, pulling down
her brown print sleeves over her brown wrists.</p>

<p>“<i>Che!</i>” said she, “if it is a runaway match I cannot
do this.”</p>

<p>I looked at Nichola in amazement. I was used to
her denials; these were merely the form that her
emotion took. I was used to her prejudices; these
were her only pastime. But I had never before
heard her offer an objection which seemed to have a
reason.</p>

<p>“Why not—but why not, Nichola?” I cried.</p>

<p>“I had a sister,” Nichola explained unexpectedly;
and in all these forty years and more I had never
before heard her sister’s name upon her lips. “She
went quietly, quietly to San Rafael an’ a priest
married her to Beppo an’ they came home for supper.
But no good came. Beppo was drown’ from his
boat within the year an’ with him a net full of fine
fish. If it is a runaway match I cannot do this. No
good will come.”</p>

<p>“But, Nichola,” I urged reasonably, “you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
not be blamed. Though to be sure I may ask you
to telephone to Mr. Didbin, that young rector at
Inglese. But you would not be blamed. And to
make cream sherbet, that would be no part of the
ceremony. And little cakes—”</p>

<p>“No good will come!” cried Nichola shrilly; “for
the love of heaven, have I not said how Beppo was
drown’ with all his fish? It is not holy.”</p>

<p>“Nichola,” I asked with dignity, “will you be sure
to have a particularly delicious luncheon to-day?
And will you make for dessert to-night a sherbet, with
little cakes, and have it ready in the afternoon?”</p>

<p>I went away with a false majesty covering my
certainty that Nichola would pay not the slightest
heed to my injunction. Nichola is in everything a
frightful nonconformist, from habit; if to this were
really superadded a reason I could not tell what
might happen, but I felt sadly sure that Lisa and
Eric would have for their wedding feast afternoon
tea and nothing more.</p>

<p>“Nichola!” said I from the doorway, “what
made you think that they had run away?”</p>

<p>“<i>Che!</i>” said Nichola grimly, “I saw them come
in the gate. Have I lived these seventy years always,
always with my two eyes shut?”</p>

<p>As I hurried away I marveled at that. Once
Nichola had unexpectedly proved to me that she
has wishes and even dreams. Was it possible that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
she knew a lover when she saw one? After all, that
is a rare gift.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs Pelleas met me with a
manner of nothing but gravity.</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried, “isn’t it delightful? Wasn’t it
providential that they came to us?”</p>

<p>“Etarre,” said Pelleas solemnly, “I’m not at all
sure that we oughtn’t to send them straight back to
Chynmere Hall.”</p>

<p>If Pelleas had proposed persuading Lisa and Eric
to forget each other I could have been no more
amazed. Pelleas, who always pretends enormous
unconcern in all romance and secretly works with
all his might on the side of the adventure, Pelleas,
to speak in austere fashion of sending two lovers
home. What did he mean? And did he think
that a course in the flora of Europe would make
anybody any happier whatever?</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I cried, “how can you? When <i>we</i>
are so happy?”</p>

<p>“But you know we didn’t elope,” Pelleas argued.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you have loved me if we had?” I
inquired reasonably.</p>

<p>“Of course I would,” cried Pelleas, “but—”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, then,” I finished triumphantly, “it’s
the same way with them.”</p>

<p>I recall a distinct impression that I had the better
of the argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>“But you see,” Pelleas persisted gently, “after all
they are so appallingly young, Etarre. And if
Dudley Manners were to be angry and if he were
to disinherit Lisa, and so on—”</p>

<p>“As for things going wrong,” said I, “can anything
be so wrong as for two who love each other to be
separated?”</p>

<p>“No,” Pelleas admitted justly, “nothing can be.
All the same—”</p>

<p>“Pelleas!” I cried in despair, “we could have
that young rector over here, and they could be married
in the little round drawing-room—or in the
rose arbour—or in the garden at large. Think of
it—cream sherbet and little cakes afterward and
us for parents and wedding party and all. Then you
and I could go straight to Dudley Manners at Chynmere
and tell him how it was, and I <i>know</i> he would
forgive them. Pelleas! Can you really think of
that dear child spending two years with an authority
on plant life in Alaska?”</p>

<p>“Instead of going to him afterward,” said Pelleas
boldly then, “suppose you and I leave here after
luncheon and drive to Chynmere and <i>make</i> Dudley
Manners consent? And bring him and Miss Constance
Wortley back to the wedding!” he finished
with triumphant daring.</p>

<p>“And not be married secretly?” I said lingeringly,
as if the secret wedding were our own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, well,” said Pelleas, “at all events we won’t
tell him on any account where they are.”</p>

<p>So it was settled, and when presently we four went
out to our tiny dining-room courage and gayety were
in the air. Our dining-room was white and dull
blue with a wreath of roses outside every window
and a bowl of roses on the table. And if Nichola
considered it reprehensible to assist at a “runaway
match” she manifestly had no such scruple about
the luncheon to precede it for she set before us
the daintiest dishes. I could see the while how
her little, quick-lidded eyes were fixed disapprovingly
on the young lovers; but then Nichola’s
eyes disapprove of the very moon in the sky.
I wondered, as I looked at Lisa in the noon of
her fresh young beauty, and at Eric, so adoringly
in love, how Nichola could even pretend to disapproval
at sight of them; and if she had been
any one but Nichola I would have suspected
her conversion, for of her own will she served
our coffee in the rose arbour. Whereupon Pelleas
and I became absorbingly interested in the progress
of some slips which had been in the ground about
six hours and we wandered away to look at them,
cups in hand, and left those two to take their
coffee in the arbour—in memory of a certain day
when we had been left to drink our coffee alone.
And when we came back we scrupulously refrained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
from looking whether they had so much as sipped a
thimbleful.</p>

<p>Then, feeling deliciously guilty, we announced to
our guests that we had an errand which would keep
us away for an hour. And that if it should seem best
there would be ample time for the wedding on our
return. And that at all events they must decide
whether they would be married in the round drawing-room,
or in the rose arbour, or in the garden at
large. Also, not knowing what warning or summons
we might wish hurriedly to send, I added to Lisa:—</p>

<p>“And if the telephone rings, dear, you would
better answer it yourself. For it may be Cupid and
ministers of grace. No one can tell.”</p>

<p>“O, Aunt Etarre,” said Lisa prettily, “this is
perfect of you. Isn’t it, Eric?”</p>

<p>The way that Eric shook the hand of Pelleas three
times on the way to the gate might have indicated
to some that he thought it was.</p>

<p>Yet there we were, hastening out in the world to
find a possible obstacle to all that innocent joy.
Never before had we been guilty of such disaffection
or even of prudence in such a cause.</p>

<p>“Pelleas, O Pelleas,” I said as we hurried down
the lane for a carriage, “but suppose it doesn’t turn
out as we think? Suppose Dudley Manners is
furious, suppose he guesses where they are and
suppose—?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>“Pooh,” said Pelleas in splendid disdain. “Dudley
Manners. Thirty years ago I took a polo
championship away from him when he was looking
directly at me.”</p>

<p>And it needed no more than this and the sun in
the lane to reassure me.</p>

<p>From a warlike-looking farmer, a friend of ours
living at the lane’s end, we got a low phaeton and a
tall horse which we had made occasion to use before.
The drive to Chynmere occupied hardly half an
hour, and when we saw the tower of the Hall above
the chestnuts and before us the high English wall
of the park cutting the roadside sward we looked at
each other in sudden breathless abashment. After
all, Lisa was Dudley Manners’ ward, not ours.
After all, two years in Europe are commonly accepted
as desirable for a girl of twenty. In that black
hour as we drew rein at the lordly entrance of Chynmere
Hall itself I felt myself obliged to call up the
essential horror of the situation.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said, “remember: they love each
other as much as ever we did. And remember:
two years with an authority on plant life in Alaska.”</p>

<p>“Monstrous,” said Pelleas firmly.</p>

<p>On which we went bravely up the steps.</p>

<p>Our enterprise was doomed to receive a blow,
crushing and apparently mortal. Neither Mr.
Dudley Manners nor Miss Constance Wortley was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
at home. They had gone away in different directions,
the man thought, immediately after luncheon.</p>

<p>We went back tremblingly to the low phaeton and
the tall horse.</p>

<p>“O, Pelleas,” I said in despair. “And whatever
shall we do now? Those poor little people.”</p>

<p>Pelleas looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“We can take an hour,” he said. “We’ll give
Dudley Manners or the botanical lady an hour to get
back, and we’ll call again.”</p>

<p>“O, Pelleas,” I said, “and if they aren’t there then
let us go home and be married anyway—” quite as
if the wedding were our own.</p>

<p>But Pelleas shook his head.</p>

<p>“Dear,” he said, “we mustn’t, you know. We
really mustn’t. It wouldn’t do in the very least.”</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” said I irrelevantly, “we were just their
age when we were married.”</p>

<p>“So we were,” said Pelleas, and drew the tall horse
to a walk in the sun of the long green road, and we
fell to remembering.</p>

<p>Any one who has ever by any chance remembered
knows how sweet the pastime may be. Sometimes
I think that heaven must be a place where some of
the things that have been will be again. No wonder
that as we drove on our delayed mission for those two
who sat expectant and adoring in our rose garden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
a throng of phantoms of delight came about us and
held us very near. No wonder that the tall horse,
obeying his own will, took this road and that road,
leading us farther and farther in those fragrant ways
until at last where the highway ran through a little
hollow at the foot of a forbidding hill he stopped
altogether, minded to take the tops of some tender
green, cool in the shade. I recall the ditches of
yellow sweet clover and the drone of the honeybees.</p>

<p>The hollow was on the edge of Chynmere village.
Across the green we saw the parish church, white in
its elms and alders. I noted absently that a smart
trap and a satin horse waited outside the iron fence
and that several figures were emerging from the
chapel door where the white-haired rector lingered.</p>

<p>“We can ask those people,” suggested Pelleas,
“for the shortest cut back to the Hall. I’m afraid
the time is getting on.”</p>

<p>He gathered up the lines and drove leisurely
across the springing turf. A song sparrow was
pouring out its little heart from the marsh land beyond
the church and the sounds of the afternoon
were growing every moment more beloved. Everything
was luring to delight, and here were Pelleas and
I alone of all the world—save Dudley Manners and
this Miss Wortley—seeking to postpone a great
happiness.</p>

<p>“Dudley Manners,” said I out of the fullness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
my heart, “must be a kind of ogre. And as for this
Miss Wortley, I dare say she is a regular Nichola.”</p>

<p>At this Pelleas said something so softly that I did
not hear and drew rein beside the smart trap in
which a man and a woman coming from the church
had just taken their places. And when I looked
up I saw the man turning toward us a face so smiling
and so deliciously abashed that it bewildered my
recognition, until—</p>

<p>“Dudley Manners!” cried Pelleas. “The very
man I am searching the county for.”</p>

<p>And to this Dudley Manners said:—</p>

<p>“I say, Pelleas—you’re a bit late—but how in
the world did you guess?”</p>

<p>“Guess?” said Pelleas, puzzled. “Guess you?”</p>

<p>“Guess where—I should say guess what. Did
you know I telephoned?” said Dudley Manners all
at once; and then having leaped from the trap and
bent above my hand he turned to the lady who had
sat beside him, an exquisite elderly woman with a
lapful of fresia. “This is Mrs. Manners,” he said
with charming pride. “The fact is, we’ve just been
married in the chapel there.”</p>

<p>At this my heart leaped to a thousand tunes all
carrying one happy air.</p>

<p>“You see,” he was explaining, looking up at us
with an eagerness almost boyish in his transfigured
face, “we—we decided rather suddenly. And we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
telephoned over to you an hour ago to get you to
come and stand by us—”</p>

<p>“Telephoned to us—at the lodge?” I cried in
dismay. “O, <i>who</i> came to the telephone?”</p>

<p>Dudley Manners looked as if he wondered what
<i>that</i> had to do with his happiness.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” he said. “The voice was
familiar. I thought at first it might have been you,
Etarre. And then they cut us off; and then a
terrible voice thundered that neither of you was
there. How did you know what we wanted?” he
went back to his text.</p>

<p>But as for me I could think only of the terror of
those poor little people, and I could guess that Nichola
must some way have come to the rescue. I knew her
voice over the telephone, like all three voices of
Cerberus, saying, “Not at home.”</p>

<p>“Dudley,” said I faintly, “Pelleas—tell him.
Ask him.”</p>

<p>I gave Dudley Manners my hand and got to the
ground, trembling, and crossed to the trap where
the lady was so tranquilly seated, with the fresia in
her lap. I said insane, unremembered vagaries to
her, all the time listening to that murmur beside the
phaeton and knowing that the fate of our little lovers
was being decided then and there. And suddenly it
came to me that the face in which I was looking was
uncommonly sweet and kindly and that inasmuch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
as she was Mrs. Manners and a bride I might give
her my confidence and win her heart for my hope.
But when I turned boldly to tell her something of the
charming case she was holding out to me some sprays
of her fresia.</p>

<p>“Won’t you have this?” she said. “It is a very
rare species.”</p>

<p>And then I knew her and I marveled that I had
not understood at once. This—this would be no
other than Miss Constance Wortley, the botanical
lady herself. And in the same instant to quicken
my assurance Dudley Manners, laughing deliciously,
called softly to her:—</p>

<p>“Constance—Constance. It’s all right. Lisa
and Eric are bound to be married to-day and I fancy
you’ll have to take me to Europe alone!”</p>

<p>Ah, such a moment of tender, abashed laughter
and open rejoicing. And of course Pelleas and I
opened our hearts and told them where the lovers
were, and who had doubtless answered the telephone
at the lodge. And forthwith we invited them to
drive with us to the wedding, and to have tea in
the garden. And so it was settled, and away we
went down the golden road dipping between deep,
deep green, and boldly past the tower of Chynmere
Hall and through the gracious land of afternoon
back to Little Rosemont lodge, bearing the
glad tidings to usher in the glad event. Tea or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
cream sherbet, what a world this is always turning
out to be.</p>

<p>“We will go in and explain,” I cried—how I
love to explain when best things are true—“and then,
Pelleas, you must hurry over in the phaeton for Mr.
Didbin, and bring him back with you, no matter what.
And then we will be married—in the drawing-room
or the rose arbour or the garden at large.”</p>

<p>I love to recall the pleasure of that alighting at the
lodge gates, of going within, of looking across the roses
for the two whom we were to surprise. I caught a
flutter of white in the arbour and, palpitating, I led
the way past the pool and the fountain and the
trickling outlet where a scarlet wing flashed into
flight and past the Hundred-leaved rose, to the turn
in the path that led to the arbour.</p>

<p>Then without warning, outside the arbour entrance
there seemed to rise from the gravel the
amazing figure of Nichola—Nichola in her best
black gown and embroidered white apron and an
unmistakable manner of threatening us with folded
arms. She stood squarely before us, looking at Pelleas
and me with all the disapproval of those little,
deep-set, quick-lidded eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” she said grimly, “go back. <i>The
weddin’s on.</i>”</p>

<p>In the same instant, through the low-arched doorway
of the arbour, I saw Lisa and Eric and the questioning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
distressed face of the Reverend Arthur
Didbin.</p>

<p>Nichola followed my glance.</p>

<p>“It’s none o’ his doin’,” she explained shrilly.
“It’s my doin’. We knew who was on the telephone,
well enough. She answered it herself,” she
explained, with a jerk of her shoulders toward the
arbour, “an’ near fainted in my arms. She knew
him. An’ we knew what was like to happen when
he got here. I went quickly, quickly for the minister
an’ here he is. You must not interfere. It is
not holy!”</p>

<p>Nichola, that grim old woman, as the ally and not
the adversary of Love! But I had no time to marvel
at the death of either prejudice or reason.</p>

<p>“Nichola—but Nichola!” I cried breathlessly,
“we haven’t come to interfere. We don’t want to
interfere. We were going to send for Mr. Didbin
ourselves.”</p>

<p>At that Nichola drew back, but doubtfully, with
mutterings. And she did not disappear until little
Lisa, having seen the radiant faces of <i>our</i> bride and
groom, suddenly understood and ran to them. And
as for Dudley Manners, one would have said that his
dearest wish had been to see Lisa married to Eric
Chartres; and as for Mrs. Manners, with her kind
eyes, all her fresia scattered in the path as she
kissed Lisa, I think that she cannot even have noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
our Hundred-leaved rose or cared whether
it had come to us from its native Caucasus or her
own Alaska.</p>

<p>I protest that I cannot now remember whether
Lisa and Eric were married by the fountain or in
the rose arbour or in the garden at large. But I
know that it must have been out of doors, for I remember
the roses and how the sun was slanting madly
in every direction and butterflies were vanishing
against the blue.</p>

<p>And when it was over and we sat in the gracious
afternoon talking joyously of what had happened
and of how strangely it was come about and of how
heavenly sweet the world is, there came Nichola from
the house bearing to the table in the little arbour a
tray unmistakably laden with her cream sherbet and
with mounds of her delicate cake.</p>

<p>“Nichola!” I cried as I hurried to her. “You <i>did</i>
make it?”</p>

<p>Nichola looked at me from her little deep eyes.</p>

<p>“I made it, yes,” she said, “an’ that was why I
went for the minister. I’d begun it, an’ I wasn’t
going to have it wasted. It would not be holy.”</p>

<p>It is true that Nichola can use the same argument
on both sides of a question. But I have never been
able to see the slightest objection to that if only the
question is settled properly at last.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVI">XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">“SO THE CARPENTER ENCOURAGED THE GOLDSMITH”</p>

<p>They were all to spend Christmas eve with us,
our nearest and dearest. On Christmas day even
the kinfolk farthest removed, both as to kin and
to kind, have a right by virtue of red holly to
one’s companionship. But Christmas eve is for
the meeting of one’s dearest and they had all
been summoned to our house: The Chartres, the
Cleatams, Miss Willie Lillieblade, Hobart Eddy,
Avis and Lawrence, and Enid and David and
the baby. As for Viola and Our Telephone and
Lisa and Eric they were all in Naples and I dare
say looking in each other’s eyes as if Vesuvius were
a mere hill.</p>

<p>There was to be with us one other—Eunice Wells,
who was lame. She was in New York on the
pleasant business of receiving a considerable legacy
from a relative, a friend of ours, whose will, though
Eunice had previously been unknown to Pelleas
and me, endeared her to us.</p>

<p>“To my beloved niece, Eunice Wells,” the testament
went, “I give and bequeath This and That for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
her piety, her love of learning and her incomparable
courage in bearing sorrow.”</p>

<p>Was not that the living May breathing in a rigid
and word-bound instrument of the law? And what
a picture of Eunice Wells. Pelleas and I had sought
her out, welcomed her, and bidden her on Christmas
eve to dine with us alone and to grace our merry
evening.</p>

<p>At five o’clock on the day before Christmas, just
as Pelleas and I rested from holly hanging and were
longing for our tea, Hobart Eddy was announced. I
say “announced” because we usually construe
Nichola’s smile at our drawing-room door to mean
Hobart Eddy. She smiles for few but to Hobart she
is openly complaisant, unfolding from the leather
of her cheek an expression of real benignity.</p>

<p>“How very jolly you look,” he said, as we sat in
the ingle. “Holly over the blindfold Hope and down
the curtains and, as I live, mistletoe on the sconces.
Aunt Etarre, I shall kiss you from sconce to sconce.”</p>

<p>“Do,” said I; “of late Pelleas is grown appallingly
confident of my single-minded regard.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” Hobart said, “nobody wants to kiss me
for myself alone.”</p>

<p>On which he put back his head and sat looking up
at the blindfold Hope, wreathed with holly. And
his fine, square chin without threat of dimple, and
his splendid, clear-cut face, and his hand drooping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
a little from the arm of his chair sent me back
to my old persistent hope. Heaven had manifestly
intended him to be a Young Husband. He of
all men should have been sitting before his own
hearth of holly and later making ready the morrow’s
Yule-tree for such little hearts as adore Yule-trees....</p>

<p>Suddenly Hobart Eddy looked over at us and,
“I say, you know,” he said, “what <i>do</i> you think it
is all for?”</p>

<p>“The holly?” Pelleas asked unsuspectingly.</p>

<p>“The mistletoe?” I hazarded.</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Hobart Eddy with simplicity,
“everything.”</p>

<p>Pelleas and I looked at each other almost guiltily.
Here were we two, always standing up for life and
promising others that it would yield good things;
and yet what in the world could we say to that question
of Hobart’s, fairly general though it is: “What
is it all for?”</p>

<p>Pelleas spoke first, as became the more philosophical.</p>

<p>“It’s to do one’s best, wouldn’t one say?” he said,
“and to let the rest go.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I see,” said Hobart Eddy, talking the
primal things in his trim staccato, “but it’s so deuced
unnatural not to know <i>why</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Pelleas admitted, “yes, it is unnatural.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
But when one does one’s worst it gets more unnatural
than ever.”</p>

<p>Hobart Eddy looked critically at the fire.</p>

<p>“But, Good Lord,” he said helplessly, “suppose—suppose
a black beetle argues that way, and does
his best, and lives to a good old beetle age. And
suppose another black beetle gives up in the beginning,
and takes some morphine-for-beetles, and next
minute gets crushed by a watering cart. What
then?”</p>

<p>“But I,” said Pelleas with admirable dignity, “am
not a beetle.”</p>

<p>“But confound it, sir,” Hobart said, “I’m afraid
I am. That’s the difference.”</p>

<p>“All philosophical arguments,” Pelleas observed,
wrinkling the corners of his eyes, “end that way. But
beetles or not, doing one’s best is the only way out.”</p>

<p>“But the ‘best’ of a beetle—” Hobart shrugged.</p>

<p>Then I spoke out with conviction.</p>

<p>“You, for example, Hobart Eddy,” I said, “would
be a perfect husband.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear heart,” he replied, “it’s a common
virtue, that.”</p>

<p>“It’s very uncommon,” I protested stoutly; “I can
think of no one besides Pelleas and you and Wilfred
and Horace and Lawrence and David and Our Telephone
and Eric who in the least possess it. Hobart
Eddy, if you would marry—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t tell me, Aunt Etarre,” he said, “that a
married beetle is in the scheme of things any nearer
the solution than a single one. Besides—” he added
and stopped. I had noted, when we were on this
not infrequent subject, that he was wont to say this,
and stop; and when he did so my heart always went
a thought faster than my reason: What if he did love
some one of whom we had never guessed? But that
I dismissed as absurd; for in that case, how should
she not love him?</p>

<p>“You were meant by heaven to be a husband,” I
muttered, unconvinced, “you look at a picture on the
wall as if you were saying: ‘How are you to-day,
dear?’”</p>

<p>“But even if one does one’s best, as you say,”
Hobart went on, “it’s the being beaten in the end
that annoys me. I hate the certainty of being
beaten in the end. I can throw it off now I’m
young—comparatively young. But look at ’em
pile up: Failures, humiliations, estrangements, the
beastly little stabs at you, your own cursed mistakes—why,
one is beaten in the beginning, for
that matter. When you’re young, even a little
young, you don’t know that. But as you get
older, even supposing you do your best, you
know you’re beaten. It’s deuced unsportsmanlike
of somebody.”</p>

<p>I looked at Pelleas with the glance that means an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
alarm, for something to be done at once. He knew;
and he did quite what I had hoped.</p>

<p>“We are more than seventy,” Pelleas said serenely,
“and <i>we’re</i> not beaten.”</p>

<p>“But you—” Hobart protested, “you’ve had half
the world at your feet. You’ve won everything.
You’ve been ...” and so on, in his choicest social
hyperbole.</p>

<p>“Hobart,” Pelleas said, “Etarre and I have been
married for fifty years. In that time we have lost,
year after year, both hopes and realities. I have
seen my work harshly criticized and even justly
rejected. One year we had hardly a centime to pay
Nichola. As it is, we escape from each day by
way of the dark for fear the next will find us
penniless. We lost—we need not speak of that,
but you know how our little boy—my son—died
before his first birthday. O, do you think....
The sorrows, the estrangements, the failures, the
ill-health, the little stabs at us, above all the
cursed mistakes of my own—do you think we
have not had these? Do you think we don’t
know, Hobart? Do you think we haven’t paid, to
the last farthing? Good God!” said Pelleas. “And
yet we are not beaten. And we never shall be
beaten, dead or alive. And without defiance. Without
defiance.”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, nodding with all my might, “never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
beaten. Except for a little at a time when it hurts
most. But never beaten.”</p>

<p>“How, though?” Hobart said helplessly, “I say,
how do you do it, you know?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” Pelleas answered gravely, “I
don’t know much about myself. One doesn’t know.
I don’t know where I stop and where The Rest Of It
begins. I stop somewhere, I dare say—my consciousness
and all that must stop somewhere. But
I’ve never found the last of me. I’ve always felt as
if I were working along with a few sets of faculties
when I’ve really got no end of them. And I don’t
know where these stop. Perhaps they don’t stop at
all. And so when I get a knock-down blow I fall
all of a heap—that is, <i>as much of me as I know
about</i> falls. That much of me may be beaten. But
not the rest. And then I reach up a hand to the rest
of me that I don’t know about and I say: ‘But there’s
all that strength left that I don’t know yet. And I
don’t know where that stops. I’ve never found out
that it stops at all. It is infinite strength and I can
use it and be it when I like.’ Beaten?” said
Pelleas; “I can no more be beaten than I can be
smothered in the open air. That strength is exhaustless,
like the air. And nothing can shut it out—nothing.”</p>

<p>“Not even your own mistakes? Not even irreparable
loss?” said Hobart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>“No,” Pelleas said, “those are hardest. But not
even those.”</p>

<p>O, I could not have loved him if he had talked to
Hobart about resignation and rewards. Yet perhaps
to some these are another language for victory—I
do not know.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that better,” Pelleas demanded, “than
taking morphine-for-beetles? Besides, after a while
you learn what that Other Strength is. You learn
Who it is. And how near that Someone is. But
not always at first—not at first.”</p>

<p>“But alone ... one is so deucedly alone ...” said
Hobart uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Pelleas said, “we need an amazing
lot of little human cheerings-up. The part of us
with which we are acquainted has to be cheered up
somewhat. Well, and isn’t it—isn’t it? Look at
the charming things that are always happening!
And these help one to believe right and left.”</p>

<p>I hardly heard Nichola come in with the tea.
Hobart absently took the heavy tray from her and
then, while she arranged it:—</p>

<p>“But in the last analysis,” he said, “you’ve got to
dig your way out of things alone, haven’t you?
Nobody can help you.”</p>

<p>“No!” Pelleas cried, “no, you have not. Not
when you learn Who the strength is....”</p>

<p>But with that my attention wandered from Pelleas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
to Nichola. My Royal Sèvres always looks so surprised
at Nichola’s brown hands upon it that I
have long expected it to rebuke her for familiarity.
And if it had done so at that moment I could
have been no more amazed than to see Nichola,
still bent above the tray, rest her hands on her
knees and look sidewise and inquiringly at Hobart
Eddy.</p>

<p>“What nonsense, anyway,” Pelleas was saying,
“every one can help every one else no end. It’s not
in the big lonely fights that we can help much—but
it’s in the little human cheerings-up. When we
get strength the next thing to do is to give it. Beetles
or not—it’s merely a point of moral etiquette to
do that!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but,” Hobart said, smiling, unconscious of
Nichola’s little eyes immovably fixed on his face,
“but when they reach you out a hand people usually
pinch by instinct instead of patting.”</p>

<p>At that Nichola’s little quick-lidded eyes began
to wink, brows lifting. And, still leaning hands on
knees:—</p>

<p>“Yah!” she said, “none of what you say is so.”</p>

<p>Nichola employs the indirect method about as
habitually as do thunder and lightning. And in this
directness of hers Hobart, that master of feint and
parry, delights.</p>

<p>“No, Nichola?” he said, smiling, “no?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>She got stiffly erect, drawing her hands up her
apron to her thighs, her eyes winking so fast that I
marvel she could see at all.</p>

<p>“But the whole world helps along,” she said shrilly,
“or else we should tear each other’s eyes out. What
do I do, me? I do not put fruit peel in the waste
paper to worrit the ragman. I do not put potato
jackets in the stove to worrit the ashman. I do not
burn the bones because I think of the next poor dog.
What crumbs are left I lay always, always on the
back fence for the birds. I kill no living thing but
spiders—which the devil made. Our Lady knows
I do very little. But if I was the men with pockets
on I’d find a way! I’d find a way, me,” said
Nichola, wagging her old gray head.</p>

<p>“Pockets?” Hobart repeated, puzzled.</p>

<p>“For the love of heaven, yes!” Nichola cried.
“Pockets—money—give!” she illustrated in pantomime.
“What can I do? On Thursday nights I
take what sweets are in this house, what flowers are
on all the plants, and I carry them to a hospital I
know. If you could see how they wait for me on
the beds! What can I do? The good God gave me
almost no pockets. It is as he says,” she nodded to
Pelleas, “<i>Helping is why.</i> Yah! None of what
you say is so. Mem, I didn’t get no time to frost the
nutcakes.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter, Nichola—it doesn’t matter,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
said I, holding hard to the arms of my chair. So
that was where she went on her Thursday nights
out ... so that was where the occasional blossoms
on my plants....</p>

<p>“I dare say you’re right, you know, Nichola,”
Hobart was saying gravely.</p>

<p>She was almost out of the room but she turned,
rolling her hands in her apron.</p>

<p>“Since Bible days I was right,” she said, and leaning
forward, nodding her head at every word, to the
utter amazement of Pelleas and me: “<i>‘They helped
everybody his neighbour,’</i>” she quoted freely, “<i>‘and
everybody said to his brother, “You be of good
courage.” So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith;
and the one that smoothed with the hammer,
him that smote with the anvil.’ Che!</i>” she cried;
“you must start in that way and then some good will
come. Do I not know? Some good will come, I
say. It never, never fails.”</p>

<p>“Right, Nichola,” said Hobart, still gravely, “I
haven’t a doubt of what you say.”</p>

<p>“The tea’s all gettin’ cold,” she added indifferently
as she went between the curtains.</p>

<p>“Nichola and I,” Pelleas said in distress, “throw
in our opinions with the tea, Hobart. They don’t
come extra.” But he was smiling and so was Hobart
and so was I, with my inevitable tear.</p>

<p>The next instant Nichola was at the portières again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>“The leddy with canaries in her head is in the
lib’ry,” she said.</p>

<p>“<i>Canaries</i>, Nichola?” I echoed.</p>

<p>“It’s the truth!” she proclaimed, “the one with
canaries singin’ in her head till it shows through,”
and instantly she vanished.</p>

<p>“Whom can she mean?” said I helplessly. For I
have no acquaintance who has a bird shop though
I have always thought that bird-shop proprietors
must be charming people.</p>

<p>“It’s probably somebody with parrots on her
bonnet,” Hobart suggested helpfully.</p>

<p>I hurried across the hall, noting how the holly
wreaths showed bright in the mirrors as if the pleasantest
things were about to happen. For in dim
light a mirror does not merely photograph. It
becomes the artist and suggests. And a mirror
wreathed with holly on the day before Christmas
is no more like an ordinary mirror than an ordinary
woman is like a bride.</p>

<p>This thought was in my mind as I entered the
library and found Eunice Wells, whose “piety and
love of learning and incomparable courage in bearing
sorrow” had drawn her to us no more than had her
helplessness and her charm. And suddenly I understood
that there are some women who seem always
like brides, moving in an atmosphere apart, having
something of joy and something of wistfulness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
With Eunice the joy was paramount so that I knew
now what Nichola had meant by the “canaries singing
in her head till it shows through.” But my
heart smote me, for it seemed to me that that joy was a
flower of renunciation instead of the flower of youth.
And how should it be otherwise? For there beside
her chair lay her crutch.</p>

<p>“Ah,” I cried, “you are just in time, my dear, for
a cup of tea and a nutcake with no frosting. And
Merry Christmas—Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>I shall not soon forget her as she looked lying back
in Pelleas’ big chair, all the beauty of her face
visible, hidden by no mask of mood; and in her
cheek a dimple like the last loving touch in the
drawing of her. I had never seen an invalid with a
dimple and some way that dimple seemed to link her
with life.</p>

<p>“Besides,” I continued, “I’ve a friend whom I
want you to meet—a man, a youngish man—O,
a Merry-Christmas-and-holly-man, to whom I
am devoted. Come in as you are—the tea ruins
itself!”</p>

<p>“Ah, please,” Eunice begged at this, “will
you forgive me if I sit here instead while you
go back to your guest? I would far rather be
here and not talk to—to strangers. You will not
mind?”</p>

<p>“Do quite as you like, dear child,” I replied, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
this atrocious ethics is the only proper motto for
every hostess.</p>

<p>So, her wraps having been put aside, I made her
comfortable by the fire with magazines, and a Christmas
rose in a vase. And I went away in a kind of
misery; for here was one for whom with all my
ardour I could plan nothing. Her little crutch would
bar the way to any future of brightness. I had a
swift sense of the mockery that Christmas holly
may be.</p>

<p>“I amuse myself with nutcakes, me,” said Hobart
Eddy as I entered the drawing-room, “and where,
pray, is the Canary Lady?”</p>

<p>“She is a very fragile Canary Lady,” I answered
sadly; “she is lame, you know, Hobart.”</p>

<p>“And has she no tea?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“She was too tired to join us,” I explained; “Pelleas
will take her cup to her when Nichola brings
the hot water.”</p>

<p>“Let me take it to her,” Hobart suggested when
Nichola came in with the hot-water pot. “I won’t
stay,” he promised as I hesitated, “and do let me be
useful. I can’t look out for the emotions of the ashman
and the next poor dog, but I want to help.
<i>Helping is why</i>,” he smiled at Nichola.</p>

<p>“You must forgive Nichola and me our trespasses,”
Pelleas murmured uneasily.</p>

<p>“Forgive them? I’m going to practice them,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
Hobart said, rising; “I’m going to take tea and a nutcake
to the Canary Lady in the library and cheer her
up, carpenter to goldsmith.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said I, since “Do quite as you like”
is the proper motto for every hostess, “do so. But
mind that you do not stay <i>at all</i>.”</p>

<p>Nichola brought the little silver card tray from
the hall, and about the plate of cakes and the fragrant
cup I laid a spray or two of holly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Heigh ho! sing, heigh ho! unto the green holly:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hobart hummed as he moved away.</p>

<p>“Fancy rhyming ‘holly’ with such a sentiment!”
I cried after him.</p>

<p>Nichola stood nodding her head.</p>

<p>“<i>Che!</i>” she said, “I said a word to him about the
universe. <i>He</i> understood. Some good will come.”</p>

<p>She went away muttering and Pelleas and I
changed eyes.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” I said wonderingly, “she has ideas!”</p>

<p>We had already surprised her in an emotion or
two; but of course ideas are another matter.</p>

<p>“More and more,” Pelleas said meditatively, “I
suspect people of ideas. They seem sometimes to
have ideas when they have no minds. I dare say
they are acted on by emanations.”</p>

<p>“But, Pelleas,” I said, “think of old Nichola
going alone to that hospital on her Thursday evenings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
Think of her understanding that <i>Helping is
why</i>, and quoting from Isaiah!”</p>

<p>“She believes,” Pelleas meditated, “that our sun
is the largest body in all the systems and that our
moon is next in size. But for all that she knows
<i>Helping is why</i>. That the carpenter must encourage
the goldsmith. Yes, Nichola must be acted on by
emanations.”</p>

<p>We sat silent for a little. Then,</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” I asked irrelevantly—but
I am not sure that there is such a thing as irrelevance—“how
you insisted that every one in the
world who is worth anything loves some one as much
as we do, or else expects to do so, or else is unhappy
because the love went wrong?”</p>

<p>“And it’s true,” said Pelleas.</p>

<p>“For all but Hobart,” I assented; “it was true for
Miss Willie and for Nichola. But not for Hobart.
And I have been wondering how any one who is not
in love can live through a Christmas without falling
in love. Christmas seems a kind of loving-cup of
days.”</p>

<p>“<i>We</i> should sing it,” Pelleas suggested,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Heigh ho! sing, heigh ho! unto the green holly:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High love is high wisdom, to love not is folly:”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That is the way it really is,” said I comfortably;
and then I woke to the other realities. “Pelleas,” I
cried, “where is Hobart?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>Where was Hobart Eddy indeed? It was quite ten
minutes since he had gone with the Canary Lady’s
cup, and I had charged him not to stay <i>at all</i>.</p>

<p>“Really,” I said, “we must go after him. This
is too bad of him, too—I can’t forgive myself. Let
us go after him, Pelleas.”</p>

<p>I took the little hot-water pot for an excuse and
we went across the hall.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Heigh ho! sing, heigh ho! unto the green holly:</div>

    <div class="verse indent8">Then, heigh ho! the holly!</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">This life is most jolly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pelleas hummed the whole way.</p>

<p>The library door was ajar and we entered together.
Do you think that we did not feel the
bewilderment of gods and men when we saw, in the
firelight, Hobart Eddy with Eunice Wells in his arms?</p>

<p>I hugged my little hot-water pot and could find
no words as they turned and saw us. But ah,
Hobart Eddy’s face! I say to every one that it was
transfigured, like the face of one who has found the
secret of the days. And as for dear Eunice—but
then, had not I, who am a most discerning old
woman, already comprehended that Eunice had
looked like a bride from the beginning?</p>

<p>“Aunt Etarre!” cried Hobart Eddy like a boy,
“I’ve found her again. I’ve found her!”</p>

<p>I clasped Pelleas’ arm while I tried to understand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
We who had despaired of contriving for Hobart Eddy
a concrete romance, were we to gather that this was
love at first sight, on our hearth-rug? Even we have
never officiated at anything so spectacular as love at
first sight. But my mind caught and clung to that
“again.”</p>

<p>“‘Again’?” I echoed it.</p>

<p>“I have loved her for years,” Hobart said; “she
was to have been my wife. And she went away,
went without a word, so that I couldn’t trace her,
and why do you think she did that? Because the
lameness came—and she never let me know.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t ... I thought ... O, I ought not
now ...” Eunice cried, “but not because I don’t
care. O, never that!”</p>

<p>On which, “Hobart Eddy! Eunice!” I uttered.
“Like a Young Husband, you know—didn’t I say
so? Haven’t I always said so? Pelleas, you see the
rule does apply to Hobart too! And I thought of a
bride at once, at once and then that dimple—O,”
said I, “I don’t know in the least what I’m talking
about—at least you don’t know. But I don’t care,
because I’m so glad.”</p>

<p>“You dear fairy god-people,” Hobart Eddy said
in the midst of his happiness, “you told me charming
things were always happening!”</p>

<p>“To help us to believe,” I heard Pelleas saying to
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>O, I wish that we two had had more to do in bringing
it all about. As it was I was very thankful that
it proved not to be love at first sight, for I would see
one’s love, like one’s bonnets, chosen with a fine
deliberation. But about this affair there had been
the most sorrowful deliberation. Pelleas and I sat
on the sofa before them and they told us a fragment
here and a fragment there and joy over all. Hobart
Eddy had met her years before in her little New England
town. His wooing had been brief and, because
of an aunt who knew what it was to be an ogre, nearly
secret. Week by week through one Spring he had
gone to see Eunice, and then had come her ugly fall
from her saddle of which until now he had never
known; for when she understood that the lameness
was likely to be incurable she and that disgustingly
willing aunt had simply disappeared and left no trace
at all.</p>

<p>“What else could I do?” Eunice appealed to us
simply; “I loved him ... how could I let him sacrifice
his life to me ... a cripple? Aunt Lydia
said he would forget. I had no home; we were
staying here and there for Aunt Lydia’s health;
and to leave no trace was easy. What else could
I do?”</p>

<p>“O,” Hobart Eddy said only, “Eunice, Eunice!”
There was that in his voice which made Pelleas
and me look at him in the happiest wonder. And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
remembered that other note in his voice that day
in the orchard with Enid’s baby. In the statue story
Pelleas and I have never believed that Galatea came
to life alone. For we think that the Pygmalions have
an awakening not less sacred.</p>

<p>I do not in the least remember how Pelleas and I
got out of the room. I do remember that we two
stood in the middle of our drawing-room looking at
each other, speechless with the marvel of what had
come. No wonder that the blindfold Hope over
the mantel had wreathed herself in holly!</p>

<p>It was late when Hobart hurried home to dress
and it was later still when we four had dinner which
I do not recall that any of us ate. And then Pelleas
and I left those two in the library in the presence of
their forgotten coffee while we flew distractedly about
giving last touches for our party, an event which had
all but slipped our minds.</p>

<p>“Pelleas,” said I, lighting candles, “think how we
planned that Hobart’s wife must be a woman of
the world!”</p>

<p>“But Eunice,” Pelleas said, “is a woman of many
worlds.”</p>

<p>Our shabby drawing-room was ablaze with red
candles; and what with holly red on the walls and
the snow banking the casements and bells jingling
up and down the avenue, the sense of Christmas
was very real. For me, Christmas seems always to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
be just past or else on the way; and that sixth sense
of Christmas being actually <i>Now</i> is thrice desirable.</p>

<p>On the stroke of nine we two, waiting before the
fire, heard Nichola on the basement stairs; and by
the way in which she mounted, with labor and
caution, I knew that she was bringing the punch.
We had wished to have it ready—that harmless
steaming punch compounded from my mother’s
recipe—when our guests arrived, so that they should
first of all hear the news and drink health to Eunice
and Hobart.</p>

<p>Nichola was splendid in her scarlet merino and
that vast cap effect managed by a starched pillowcase
and a bit of string, and over her arm hung
a huge holly wreath for the bowl’s brim. When she
had deposited her fragrant burden and laid the wreath
in place she stood erect and looked at us solemnly
for a moment, and then her face wrinkled in all directions
and was lighted with her rare, puckered smile.</p>

<p>“Mer—ry Christmas!” she said.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, Nichola!” we cried, and I
think that in all her years with us we had never before
heard the words upon her lips.</p>

<p>“Who goes ridin’ behind the sleigh-bells to-night?”
she asked then abruptly.</p>

<p>“<i>Who</i> rides?” I repeated, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Nichola said; “this is a night when all
folk stay home. The whole world sits by the fire on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
Christmas night. An’ yet the sleigh-bells ring like
mad. It is not holy.”</p>

<p>Pelleas and I had never thought of that. But
there may be something in it. Who indeed, when all
the world keeps hearth-holiday, who is it that rides
abroad on Christmas night behind the bells?</p>

<p>“Good spirits, perhaps, Nichola,” Pelleas said,
smiling.</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it,” Nichola declared gravely;
“that is not holy either—to doubt.”</p>

<p>“No,” we said, “to doubt good spirits is never
holy.”</p>

<p>On this we heard the summons at our door, and
Nichola went off to answer it. And in came all our
guests at once from dinner at the Chartres’; and at
Nichola’s bidding they hastened straight to the
drawing-room and cried their Christmas greetings
to Pelleas and me, who stood serving the steaming
punch before the fireplace.</p>

<p>They were all there: Madame Sally in black
velvet and a diamond or two; Polly Cleatam with—as
I live!—a new dimple; and Wilfred and Horace
acting as if Christmas were the only day on the
business calendar; Miss Willie Lillieblade, taking
a Christmas capsule from the head of her white
staff; Avis and Lawrence, always dangerously likely
to be found conferring in quiet corners; and Enid
and David and the baby—we had insisted on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
baby and he had arrived, in a cocoon of Valenciennes.
And when the glasses had been handed
round, Pelleas slipped across the hall to the library
and reappeared among us with Eunice and Hobart.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear friends,” Pelleas said, “dear
friends....”</p>

<p>But one look in the faces of those three was
enough. And I, an incarnate confirmation, stood on
the hearth-rug nodding with all my might.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how merry we were in that moment
or how in love with life. I cannot recall what
tender, broken words were said or what toasts were
drunk. But I remember well enough the faces of
Eunice and Hobart Eddy; and I think that the holly-wreathed
mirrors must have found it difficult to
play the artist and suggest, because that which they
had merely to reflect was so much more luminous.</p>

<p>In the midst of all, Nichola, bringing more glasses,
spoke at my elbow.</p>

<p>“Mem,” she asked, “air them two goin’ to get
marrit?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Nichola,” I said, “yes, they are. They are!”</p>

<p>Nichola stood looking at me and winking fast, as
if the air were filled with dust. And then came that
curious change in her face which I had seen there
before: a look as if her features were momentarily
out of drawing, by way of bodying forth some unwonted
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p>“I made that match,” Nichola acknowledged
briefly.</p>

<p>“Nichola!” I said in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“It’s so,” she maintained solemnly; “didn’t I say
a word to him this afternoon—a word about the
universe? He begun to understand how to act.
For the love of heaven, did I not <i>say</i> some good would
come?”</p>

<p>“You did say so, Nichola,” I answered, “and certainly
the good has come.”</p>

<p>“<i>Che!</i>” said Nichola, nodding her head, “I am
sure about all things, me.”</p>

<p>I turned to Pelleas, longing to tell him that we
were finding the end of one rainbow after another.
And Pelleas was at that moment lifting his glass.</p>

<p>“Here’s to Christmas,” he cried as he met my
eyes, “the loving cup of days!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVII">XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">CHRISTMAS ROSES</p>

<p>When our guests were gone Pelleas and I sat for
some while beside the drawing-room fire. They
had brought us a box of Christmas roses and these
made sweet the room as if with a secret Spring—a
Little Spring, such as comes to us all, now and then,
through the year. And it was the enchanted hour,
when Christmas eve has just passed and no one is
yet awakened by the universal note of Get-Your-Stocking-Before-Breakfast.</p>

<p>“For that matter,” Pelleas said, “every day is a
loving cup, only some of us see only one of its handles:
Our own.”</p>

<p>And after a time:—</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a legend,” he wanted to know, “or
if there isn’t one there ought to be one, that the first
flowers were Christmas roses and that you can detect
their odour in all other flowers? I’m not sure,”
he warmed to the subject, “but that they say if you
look steadily, with clear eyes, you can see all about
every flower many little lines, in the shape of a Christmas
rose!”</p>

<p>Of course nothing beautiful is difficult to believe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
Even in the windows of the great florists, where the
dear flowers pose as if for their portraits, we think
that one looking closely through the glass may see
in their faces the spirit of the Christmas roses. And
when the flowers are made a gift of love the spirit
is set free. Who knows? Perhaps the gracious little
spirit is in us all, waiting for its liberty in our best gifts.</p>

<p>And at thought of gifts I said, on Christmas eve
of all times, what had been for some time in my
heart:—</p>

<p>“Pelleas, we ought—we really ought, you know,
to make a new will.”</p>

<p>The word casts a veritable shadow on the page as
I write it. Pelleas, conscious of the same shadow,
moved and frowned.</p>

<p>“But why, Etarre?” he asked; “I had an uncle
who lived to be ninety.”</p>

<p>“So will you,” I said, “and still—”</p>

<p>“He began translating Theocritus at ninety,”
Pelleas continued convincingly.</p>

<p>“I’ll venture he had made his will by then, though,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Is that any reason why I should make mine?”
Pelleas demanded. “I <i>never</i> did the things my family
did.”</p>

<p>“Like living until ninety?” I murmured.</p>

<p>O, I could not love Pelleas if he was never unreasonable.
It seems to me that the privilege of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
unreason is one of the gifts of marriage; and when
I hear The Married chiding each other for the exercise
of this gift I long to cry: Is it not tiresome enough
in all conscience to have to keep up a brave show of
reason for one’s friends, without wearing a uniform
of logic in private? Laugh at each other’s unreason
for your pastime, and Heaven bless you.</p>

<p>Pelleas can do more than this: He can laugh at
his own unreason. And when he had done so:—</p>

<p>“Ah, well, I know we ought,” he admitted, “but
I do so object to the literary style of wills.”</p>

<p>It has long been a sadness of ours that the law
makes all the poor dead talk alike in this last office
of the human pleasure, so that cartman and potentate
and philosopher give away their chattels to the
same dreary choice of forms. No matter with what
charming propriety they have in life written little
letters to accompany gifts, most sensitively shading
the temper of bestowal, yet in the majesty of their
passing they are forced into a very strait-jacket
of phrasing so that verily, to bequeath a thing to
one’s friend is well-nigh to throw it at him. Yes, one
of the drawbacks to dying is the diction of wills.</p>

<p>Pelleas meditated for a moment and then laughed
out.</p>

<p>“Telegrams,” said he, “are such a social convenience
in life that I don’t see why they don’t extend
their function. Then all we should need would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
two witnesses, ready for anything, and some yellow
telegraph blanks, and a lawyer to file the messages
whenever we should die, telling all our friends what
we wish them to have.”</p>

<p>At once we fell planning the telegrams, quite as
if the Eye of the Law knew what it is to wrinkle at
the corners.</p>

<p>As,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawrence Knight</span>,<br />
Little Rosemont,
</p>
<p class="indentli tight">L.I.</p>

<p>I wish you to have my mother’s pearls and her mahogany
and my Samarcand rug and my Langhorne Plutarch and a kiss.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Aunt Etarre.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Eric Chartres</span><br />
To His Club,
</p>

<p>Come to the house and get the Royal Sèvres tea-service on which
you and Lisa had your first tea together and a check made out to
you in my check book in the library table drawer.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Uncle Pelleas.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>And so on, with the witnesses’ names properly in
the corners.</p>

<p>“Perfect,” said I with enthusiasm. “O, Pelleas,
let us get a bill through to this effect.”</p>

<p>“But we may live to be only ninety, you know,”
he reminded me.</p>

<p>We went to the window, presently, and threw it
open on the chance of hearing the bird of dawning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
singing all night long in the Park, which is of course,
in New York, where it sings on Star of Bethlehem
night. We did not hear it, but it is something to
have been certain that it was there. And as we
closed the casement,</p>

<p>“After all,” Pelleas said seriously, “the Telegraph
Will Bill would have to do only with property.
And a will ought to be concerned with soberer matters.”</p>

<p>So it ought, in spite of its dress of diction, rather
like the motley.</p>

<p>“A man,” Pelleas continued, “ought to have something
more important to will away than his house and
his watch and his best bed. A man’s poor soul, now—unless
he is an artist, which he probably is not—has
no chance verbally to leave anybody anything.”</p>

<p>“It makes its will every day,” said I.</p>

<p>“Even so,” Pelleas contended, “it ought to die
rich if it’s anything of a soul.”</p>

<p>And that is true enough.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” Pelleas suggested, “the telegrams
were to contain something like this: ‘And from my
spirit to yours I bequeath the hard-won knowledge
that you must be true from the beginning. But if by
any chance you have not been so, then you must be
true from the moment that you know.’ Why not?”</p>

<p>Why not, indeed?</p>

<p>“I think that would be mine to give,” Pelleas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
said reflectively; “and what would yours be, Etarre?”
he asked.</p>

<p>At that I fell in sudden abashment. What could
I say? What would I will my poor life to mean to
any one who chances to know that I have lived at
all? O, I dare say I should have been able to formulate
many a fine-sounding phrase about the passion
for perfection, but confronted with the necessity
I could think of nothing save a few straggling truths.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said I uncertainly; “I am sure
of so little, save self-giving. I should like to bequeath
some knowledge of the magic of self-giving. Now
Nichola,” I hazarded, to evade the matter, “would
no doubt say: ‘And from my soul to your soul this
word about the universe: <i>Helping is why.</i>’”</p>

<p>“But you—you, Etarre,” Pelleas persisted; “what
would the real You will to others, in this mortuary
telegram?”</p>

<p>And as I looked at him I knew.</p>

<p>“O, Pelleas,” I said, “I think I would telegraph
to every one: ‘From my spirit to your spirit, some
understanding of the preciousness of love. And the
need to keep it true.’”</p>

<p>I shall always remember with what gladness he
turned to me. I wished that his smile and our
bright hearth and our Christmas roses might bless
every one.</p>

<p>“I wanted you to say that,” said Pelleas.</p>
